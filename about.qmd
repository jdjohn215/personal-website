Welcome!

As more and more of the internet gets eaten by the continuous algorithmic scroll, my hope is to preserve a bit of the old, eclectic internet I grew up with.

To that end, this website includes various personal and professional written projects. Many of these appeared somewhere else first; my goal is to gather and preserve them all in one convenient place. It's a work in progress.

If you find something that interests you, feel free to email me at jdjohn215 [at] gmail [dot] com.

## about me

I live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin where I'm employed as a Research Fellow at the Marquette University Law School. At work, I mainly study housing, demographics, and elections in Wisconsin. Other interests I occasionally write about include ecology, geography, 20th century history, and American religion.
