Kelly did best in the suburbs to the south of Milwaukee County where he won Franklin and Hales Corners. Karofsky's largest victory was in Shorewood. This most reliably Democratic municipality in Wisconsin gave her 86% of the vote. In fact, all of her greatest victories (apart from the City of Milwaukee) came in the wealthy North Shore suburbs. She got more than 70% of the vote in Fox Point, Bayside, Glendale, and Shorewood.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page layout-nrow=\"1\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"reactable html-widget html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-19965d401cfed1ee202b\" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-19965d401cfed1ee202b\">{\"x\":{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"Reactable\",\"attribs\":{\"data\":{\"municipality\":[\"C.

His best performances came in the two primarily white (with significant Latino minorities) working class suburbs of West Milwaukee (44%) and West Allis (41%). He did worst in the likewise predominately white, but quite wealthy North Shore suburbs of Bayside, Fox Point, River Hills, and Whitefish Bay.

David Crowley defeated Chris Larson by just over 1,000 votes. Both men are Democratic state legislators, but Crowley ran as the more moderate choice while Larson is an avowed progressive. This led to an unusual set of coalitions for Milwaukee County. David Crowley overwhelming carried his political base on Milwaukee's North and Northwest Sides. To this he added victories in Brown Deer, River Hills, Whitefish Bay, Hales Corners, Bayside, Franklin, and Greendale. Larson won the rest of the City of Milwaukee, but with less overwhelming support. He also won victories in St. Francis, Shorewood, Cudahy, South Milwaukee, West Allis, (and narrowly in) Oak Creek, West Milwaukee, Wauwatosa, Greenfield, and Fox Point.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page layout-nrow=\"1\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"reactable html-widget html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-8d2ac87a19fcd3262599\" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-8d2ac87a19fcd3262599\">{\"x\":{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"Reactable\",\"attribs\":{\"data\":{\"municipality\":[\"C.

Readers may have noticed that neither Lena Taylor and David Crowley, both African Americans, won many City of Milwaukee wards that didn't also have a black majority. I calculate that 127 of Milwaukee's 324 wards have a non-Hispanic white majority. Crowley won 16 of them and, Taylor won 2.\n\nDespite this, David Crowley still managed to win a majority of the city's vote (52% to Larson's 48%), while Taylor ran far behind him, winning just 37% of the citywide vote. This is because Crowley won an exceedingly large share of the vote in majority black wards (75%) while minimizing his loses in the majority white parts of the city where he got 40% of the vote.
