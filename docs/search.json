    "section": "",
    "text": "This article originally appeared in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\nThe novel coronavirus changed life in metropolitan Milwaukee. For weeks, streets and shopping malls were eerily quiet. Hotels and office towers were mostly empty. The Democratic National Convention, Milwaukee’s chance to strut its stuff before a national audience, was moved from July to August in hopes that the health crisis would ease and at least some version of the convention could be held.\nFor civic boosters, landing the Democratic convention was proof that Milwaukee was a city on the rise. Before the virus hit, they saw a metropolitan area growing in vitality and confidence. But buried beneath the COVID-19 headlines was a recent release from the U.S. Census Bureau that points to a key type of growth missing from our comeback story, something metro Milwaukee will have to contend with after the virus passes.\nThe official 2020 census count is still underway, but Census Bureau population estimates show that in the last decade, thousands of metro Milwaukee residents have left the area for other parts of the country, and we’re struggling to replace them.\nWe’re lagging in a key metric that often reflects the vitality and desirability of a metro area: population growth.\nFor comparison, consider our neighbor to the northwest. To some on the coasts, Minneapolis and Milwaukee are virtually indistinguishable. Two “M” cities in fly-over country, easily and often confused.\nTo be sure, the Minneapolis and Milwaukee metro areas do have some similarities. Besides the obvious — climate — we are places with abundant natural resources, including vast amounts of freshwater. Our economies feature more Fortune 500 companies than most similar-size cities. Both metros have plenty of cultural assets.\nThere also are important differences. Metro Minneapolis, which includes St. Paul and Bloomington, is home to the state’s flagship university and capitol. Metro Milwaukee is not. But there’s another significant differentiation: population growth. According to new U.S. Census Bureau population estimates, the Minneapolis metropolitan area added 306,000 new residents between 2010 and 2019. The Milwaukee metro area added 19,000.\nThe population of metro Minneapolis grew 9.2%. Metro Milwaukee grew 1.2%.\nMinneapolis isn’t the only Midwestern metropolitan area that’s been growing. Since 2010, metro Kansas City’s population grew 7.4%. Metro Indianapolis grew a whopping 9.9%.\nThe new census estimates show that after a booming start to the decade, many metro areas around the country have seen growth rates decline in the last several years. But metro Milwaukee never experienced the boom."

    "section": "Milwaukee is near the bottom in domestic migration",
    "text": "Milwaukee is near the bottom in domestic migration\nAs part of its Milwaukee Area Project, Marquette Law School’s Lubar Center for Public Policy Research and Civic Education compiled and analyzed publicly available data from 2010 to 2019. It offers more insight into the population changes occurring in the Milwaukee Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), which the Census Bureau defines as Milwaukee, Waukesha, Ozaukee, and Washington counties.\nPopulation change is determined by three things — birth, death and migration.\nOf 384 metropolitan areas in the U.S., we rank 39th in total population, with about 1,575,000 residents.\nWe’re 46th in the nation in natural increase, which is births minus deaths. So far this decade, metro Milwaukee has had 59,000 more births than deaths. It’s a relatively healthy number. For example, the Pittsburgh metro area had 36,000 more deaths than births.\nWe are ranked 49th in net international migration. From 2010 to 2019, we attracted about 25,000 more people from another country than immigrated away. Again, hardly robust growth, but not terrible.\nBut something else is happening in metro Milwaukee, something that has serious implications for the region’s long-term economic health and vitality.\nWe rank 370th out of 384 metro areas in net domestic migration — movement within the U.S. In other words, there are only 14 metro areas in America that lost more residents to domestic migration than we did.\nFactor in our middling ability to attract international migrants, and we fall to 378th in total net migration — 378th out of 384 metro areas in the nation.\nWhen you add up everyone coming here and subtract everyone leaving the metro area, we’ve lost about 39,000 people this decade. The only places that lose more people to migration are New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Detroit, St. Louis and Cleveland. The only reason our population grew is because of a relatively strong birth rate.\nMost of our population loss comes from young adults. About 6,500 18- and 19-year-olds move to metro Milwaukee each year. But more than 10,000 leave and they don’t return in great numbers. We continue to experience net population loss among people in their mid-20s all the way through their early 30s.\nPut another way, lots of kids are born here. Where we struggle is keeping them once they grow up, and in attracting new residents to replace them.\nMetro Milwaukee’s current slow or no growth mode can be found in Milwaukee and its suburbs. In some respects, the population fortunes of communities in the region have converged. Places that were shrinking have stabilized or are treading water, while most places that were growing have seen their growth rates greatly diminish."

    "section": "Big population jumps in Milwaukee’s suburbs have leveled off",
    "text": "Big population jumps in Milwaukee’s suburbs have leveled off\nThe 1990s were a rags or riches decade for the area. Milwaukee and its inner-ring suburbs struggled. The city lost 5% of its population. Wauwatosa lost 4%, West Allis 3%.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, Mequon grew by 15%, Oak Creek an astonishing 46%.\nToday, those kind of population swings in the metro area have generally evened out.\nFor example, Oak Creek’s population growth has steadily slowed. After adding 9,000 residents in the 1990s, it added 6,000 in the 2000s and 2,000 from 2010 to 2018. In a telling reflection of the metro area’s sluggish population growth, Oak Creek — now a city of 36,000 — still has the second-fastest rate of population growth among metro-area cities with at least 20,000 residents.\nSome municipalities do better than others in attracting new residents. The city of Milwaukee is home to 38% of the metro area’s residents, but it attracts more than 42% of international immigrants and about 45% of those moving here from another state.\nThe city underperforms with people moving to the metro area from elsewhere in Wisconsin. Those people are more likely to move to one of the suburbs.\nMetro Milwaukee remains segregated by race. The population outside the city of Milwaukee is 85% white, though there is evidence that is slowly changing. The 2010s are the first decade in which the white population outside the city of Milwaukee has shrunk. From 2010-2018, it declined by 13,000, from 852,000 to 839,000.\nDuring that same time, the number of black, Asian and Latino residents outside Milwaukee grew from about 90,000 to 120,000. Adding other racial identifiers to that total, there are about 145,000 people of color now living beyond the city limits.\nThe growth of the minority population outside the city has the potential to continue. Just one-third of white residents there are under 30, compared to 40% of Asians, 45% of blacks, and half of Latinos.\nThe question is whether this younger, more diverse population will remain in metro Milwaukee. When we launched the Milwaukee Area Project in 2017, we conducted a poll of the region’s residents. We asked them to think about their community and their futures. Were they happy where they lived? Over the next five years, did they see themselves staying or moving?\nForty-seven percent of young white people said they were happy and planned on staying in their community. Only 6% of young whites said they were unhappy and planning to move. That was in stark contrast to young people of color. Just 22% said they were happy and planned on staying in their community. Another 27% said they were unhappy and planned to move.\nChanging that reality will be one of the keys to metro Milwaukee’s population growth in the future. The future success of the area in a post-COVID world depends on not just attracting new residents, but on giving the ones we already have good reasons to stay."

Although the binned map makes it easier to see patterns, it also creates two kinds of error. On the one hand it suggests an abrupt change in places where there is only a gradual shift. On the other, it also flattens outliers by incorrectly suggesting that the Mississippi River delta is as wet as the Olympic Peninsula.\nAll the data and code needed to create these maps are available in this github repo."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This article originally appeared in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\nSix years ago, Phoebe Alexander returned from an out-of-town family reunion to find a letter waiting for her at her northwest side apartment. It was from the city of Milwaukee. The owner of the duplex where she lived had failed to pay taxes. The city was taking ownership of the property near 90th Street and Silver Spring Drive.\nThe news was jarring. Alexander, her husband, and son had rented the lower level of the duplex for 11 years. But city housing officials didn’t want the Alexanders to leave. They wanted them to buy the duplex.\nAfter thinking it over, the couple said “Yes.” Today, that decision to own instead of rent is paying off.\n“I’m saving a couple hundred dollars every month,” Phoebe told us. “It’s cheaper in the end. There are just so many great benefits to being a homeowner.”\nThis is a story of what’s possible in Milwaukee: the prospect of owning your own home while saving money at the same time. But it’s also a story about a new kind of home buyer in Milwaukee — one who has little in common with families like the Alexanders and is increasingly in competition with them.\nThe full consequences of the pandemic on Milwaukee’s housing market have yet to be felt. A predicted surge in evictions is almost certain to be one of them. But another trend worth watching is what some have characterized as a legal “land grab” — the acquisition of thousands of affordable city homes and duplexes by real estate investors who do not live in Wisconsin.\nPrevious research by Marquette Law School’s Lubar Center for Public Policy Research and Civic Education documented the plummeting number of owner-occupied residential properties in Milwaukee since the Great Recession. From 2005 to 2020, the owner-occupied percentage fell from 80% to 69% . Parts of the north and west sides saw declines double that.\nEqually noteworthy is who is buying these residential properties. A new breed of distant, investment landlord has emerged. Since 2005, the number of residential properties owned by out-of-state landlords has quadrupled, from 1,300 to 6,000. Most of the properties are single-family homes or duplexes.\nInitially, these out-of-state buyers mainly purchased properties that were recently owner-occupied. But when the number of foreclosures finally declined, the out-of-state landlords pivoted and began buying more properties from local landlords, often in bulk deals. Some are conventionally bank financed. Others are paid for strictly with cash. Most of the properties are valued at less than $100,000, often considerably less.\nThese are not the “flips” made famous by HGTV, where tens of thousands of dollars in improvements leads to profitable re-sales. A check of work-permit and property records for the last four years shows that out-of-state landlords applied for considerably fewer work permits than owner occupiers and even local landlords.\nInstead, these properties are used to produce a steady stream of income for distant investors, with landlords often charging rents hundreds of dollars higher than what it would cost for someone — with just a small down payment — to own the home. The result is that that for some who can least afford it, Milwaukee is a more expensive place to live.\nAs part of the Milwaukee Area Project at Marquette Law School’s Lubar Center, we compiled and analyzed public records and data with the hope of answering several key questions: Why are these out-of-state investors doing business in Milwaukee? Have they continued to purchase homes during the pandemic? And how do the costs of renting vs. owning compare?\nFirst, the backdrop. The Great Recession produced a nationwide housing reset. In the years following the housing crisis, Wall Street backed investment groups purchased large numbers of foreclosed properties in cities such as Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Las Vegas.\nDuring a program at the Law School’s Lubar Center last fall, we talked with the author of “Homewreckers,” journalist Aaron Glantz, who detailed the business model for these new housing investment LLCs. Glantz said they typically purchased newer homes in suburban areas with warm climates and significant job growth. And then they rented them, sharply raising monthly rents.\nMilwaukee offers a different spin on the housing-as-investment model. Investors buy older, inexpensive properties, hold them, and earn steady income from renting them.\n“You not only need to be worried about a land grab with homeowners losing their homes,” Glantz told us. “But you also need to be worried about mom-and-pop landlords, people who live in the community and have a stake in the community, losing their rental property and having it sucked up by people who live far away.”"

    "text": "The impact of the pandemic\nThe increasing number of out-of-state landlords in Milwaukee reflects a nationwide trend. Single-family home rentals are a rapidly growing business model. In Milwaukee, their number has more than doubled since 2005. Currently 18,800 single-family homes are being rented inside the city limits. About half are valued at $75,000 or less. About 5,000 homes are valued at $50,000 or less.\nFor now, ownership of Milwaukee’s rented single-family homes and duplexes remains diffuse, spread among many different owners. But there are signs of consolidation. We estimate that a decade ago, the top 10 landlords owned a total of fewer than 900 houses. Now they own more than 1,800. Part of that consolidation is being fueled by the growing presence of out-of-state landlords. Ten years ago, none of the 20 largest landlords in the city was from outside Wisconsin. Today, six are from out-of-state.\nOur analysis shows that one of every seven landlord-owned homes in Milwaukee is now owned by people living out of state, and that trend could accelerate further. Some smaller, local landlords have lost significant rental income during the pandemic and are now looking to sell their properties. Out-of-state investment funds often pay with cash.\nIn collaboration with Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigative reporter Cary Spivak, we identified the nine largest out-of-state owners of houses and duplexes in Milwaukee. Again, these are landlords whose businesses are headquartered outside of Wisconsin. They include individuals from California, Texas, Ohio, and Illinois. Details about their operations can sometimes be difficult to discern, with investors often using multiple LLCs with different names for their acquisitions.\nThere are exceptions. Three of the most prolific buyers of residential properties in Milwaukee in recent years have polished websites, touting their business models and success.\nAt the end of 2020, the nine out-of-state landlords we identified owned 989 properties in Milwaukee, holding more than 1,500 units. They owned 670 single-family homes, 268 duplexes, 34 apartment buildings, and 17 other residential buildings, valued in total at $79 million. We estimate that in a normal year, city residents will pay these out-of-state landlords more than $16 million in rent. All the landlords entered the Milwaukee market after the worst of the housing crisis.\nFor this story, we took a closer look at five of the landlords.\nBulldog Ridge is led by a Chicago-area real estate investor and has a suburban Chicago mailing address. Along with a handful of associated LLCs, it owned 178 Milwaukee properties at the end of 2020, including 108 single-family homes, 54 duplexes, and 11 apartment buildings. Most of these properties are in the near south side, north side, and Sherman Park areas. The median price of the homes and duplexes owned by Bulldog Ridge is $57,400. Its lowest price home is valued at $21,600. Its most expensive is $187,800.\nMilwaukee Capital, along with sister company SCV Ventures, is led by a real estate investor based in Houston and Florida. Milwaukee Capital’s properties are found in some of the city’s most impoverished neighborhoods, primarily on the near north and near west sides. It ended 2020 with 115 properties in Milwaukee, including 66 single-family homes and 45 duplexes. The median value of the properties it owns is $42,050. That includes a home assessed at $2,800. Many of the properties had been owned by a real estate investment business once associated with former professional basketball player and Milwaukee native Devin Harris.\nSFR3, started by two technology company executives in the San Francisco area, began buying homes in Milwaukee in 2017. Along with an associated LLC, SFR3 owned 95 properties in the city entering 2021. Eighty-seven of those are single-family homes; eight are duplexes. SFR3 operates largely on the far north and northwest sides. Its median price house is valued at $89,700, but it owns homes ranging in value from $20,100 to $167,800. Its website touts “affordable homes for America’s workers,” and says its mission is “to renovate old houses in disrepair” and make them “like new.”\nVineBrook Homes is based in Dayton, Ohio, and was started by a successful venture capitalist. The company operates in other Midwestern cities, including Cincinnati, St. Louis, and Memphis. It began purchasing homes in Milwaukee in 2019, mostly on the west and northwest sides, using an LLC named “VB One.” It entered 2021 owning 250 properties: 235 single-family homes and 15 duplexes. The median value of its homes is $84,400, with its least valued property assessed at $33,400 and its most expensive valued at $201,800.\nAs the Journal Sentinel’s Spivak has reported, the economic fallout from the virus has caused both tenants and landlords to struggle. Property records indicate that most out-of-state investors we identified have paused their purchases of Milwaukee properties during the pandemic and subsequent eviction moratoriums. But several have continued to aggressively buy.\nFrom mid-March to December 2020, VB One purchased 147 homes in Milwaukee with cash. It bought 29 in just the month of December. Virtually all the properties were on the north and northwest sides of the city. In one two-day period in early May 2020, VB One purchased seven single-family homes.\nFrom mid-August to December, SFR3 purchased 39 properties in Milwaukee. Most were single-family homes. Most were paid for in cash. On a website, a representative of SFR3 identifies himself as a “Cash Buyer for Milwaukee,” and writes, “I’ve been tasked with buying 20 house(s) per month. Please reach out if you have any properties that might work.”\nA fifth landlord, based in southern California, was also busy buying Milwaukee duplexes last year, most on the near north side. The investment firm, which purchased 95 homes last year, has acquired properties here using names including “Copper Kettle” and, more recently, “Residential Properties Resources Fund ll LLC (RPRF).”\nThe LLCs are connected to a real estate investment fund called Highgrove Holdings Management LLC, of Torrance, Calif., which maintains a website with an entire page describing investment opportunities in Milwaukee. The website states that the price of a property purchased for investment purposes, including rehabilitation costs, averages $35,000. Our data analysis shows the firm’s average property is worth $32,600.\nIn addition to promising investors “12%-18% returns annually,” Highgrove’s website says the firm “focuses on cleaning up communities where purchases are made. Focus will always remain on safety, clean environment and good service for our tenants.”\nThe website also describes Highgrove’s aspirations, saying, “Highgrove has been working closely with real estate professionals in Milwaukee to seek out and acquire properties in the area at discounted prices up to and in some cases exceeding 50% off of fair market value. The goal of HHM is to amass 1,100 properties in Milwaukee.”"

    "section": "Why Milwaukee?",
    "text": "Why Milwaukee?\nWhat makes investing in Milwaukee, an older Midwestern city with stagnant population growth, lucrative?\nFirst, thousands of homes in the city are valued at less than $100,000, in some cases much less. They are easily affordable to investors looking to buy. Second, in a normal year, they generally offer an excellent return on their investment.\nHow do we know that? While we have not seen balance sheets for out-of-state landlords, we created a model using publicly available records and data that help explain what’s happening:\n\nWe estimated rents by collecting market-rate estimates of each property’s value. Our analysis found that these estimates typically vary from actual rental listings by 10 percent or less.\nWe estimated average management expenses by comparing the rates of eight local management companies to estimate a typical total management fee of 10.9% of rent. This includes tenant placement fees.\nBased on a formula used by the real estate data firm CoreLogic, we estimate maintenance fees as 17.5% of rent and insurance as 0.35% of the assessed property value.\nWe examined city records, to include taxes and assessments, but did not account for extra expenses such as legal fees and loan payments, which vary from landlord to landlord.\n\nUsing this model, we calculated potential financial returns for all nine of the larger out-of-state investors. We will focus on two of them.\nMilwaukee Capital, the Houston-based LLC, owns properties in some of the poorest sections of Milwaukee. From 2018 to 2020, it spent $4.3 million acquiring 115 properties in the city. Those properties are now assessed at $4.8 million. Most were acquired in bulk, bank-financed purchases. The company’s history of accumulating building code violations at a pace five times the citywide average for landlords suggests it has invested little in rehabbing its properties.\nIf Milwaukee Capital charges market value rates for its units and matches the citywide occupancy average, that would bring in $1.7 million each year. Subtract estimated management expenses of $182,000, property taxes of $124,000, maintenance costs of $291,000, and insurance premiums of $17,000 and you would have net annual revenue of approximately $1.1 million. That is, in just one year, 25% of the amount spent to purchase these properties. Again, this represents a more typical, non-pandemic year.\nThe leading out-of-state buyer of Milwaukee residential properties in recent years has been VB One, which lists a Dayton address. In 2020, it purchased 173 houses. No one else bought more than 95.\nIn less than two years, VB One has spent $21 million acquiring 250 properties currently assessed at a total of $21 million. Charging market-rate rents at the city’s occupancy rate would bring in annual gross revenues of $3.4 million. We estimate property management expenses of $369,000, property taxes of $554,000, maintenance costs of $590,000, and insurance premiums of $74,000, leaving net revenue of $1.8 million, or 8.7% of the entire amount spent to purchase these properties. All were paid for with cash.\nAs of June 2020, VineBrook reported an average rehab cost of $16,000 per property across its entire portfolio. Assuming it invested the same amount in Milwaukee would lower its profit rate here to 7.2% of its total investment. VineBrook Homes is a vertically integrated real estate firm that provides construction and property management services in-house, likely for a lower cost than that of local contractors."

    "section": "The advantages of owning vs. renting",
    "text": "The advantages of owning vs. renting\nWhat also makes Milwaukee lucrative is that rental rates for cheaper properties remain relatively high. We compared annual rent to total property value for residential properties owned by out-of-state landlords. For properties under $100,000, we found only a small relationship between home values and rents. Typical rent for a $40,000 single-family home is only about 10% cheaper than rent for an $80,000 house.\nAccording to Mike Gosman, the president and CEO of the nonprofit Acts Housing in Milwaukee, owning instead of renting is a better deal for many low- to moderate-income working families.\n“The math is very compelling. A lot of people are just unaware of the fact that they might be able to save $300 or $400 a month through homeownership,” Gosman said.\nIn the last year, Acts has helped more than 160 low- to moderate-income families purchase homes. The nonprofit provides services needed to transition from renter to homeowner, including home-buyer counseling, its own real estate agents, and guidance for repair projects. In addition, Acts is often the lender, with an active portfolio of 100 loans made to families fixing up and purchasing distressed homes.\n“Typically, families who purchase one of the distressed homes have total costs of $650 per month,” Gosman said. “It is very common for us to have families spending $900, $1,000, $1,100 a month to rent. And frankly, they’re renting places that are not decent.”\nGosman’s estimate of savings is supported by data analysis done for this story.\nWe estimated ownership costs by assuming a 5% down payment, a mortgage with an annual percentage rate of 4%, and a 30-year loan. We included other ownership costs of $1,000 a year: homeowner’s insurance, 1% private mortgage insurance, property taxes at 2.6%, city utilities at $200 per quarter, and monthly maintenance expenses calculated as 17.5% of the housing unit’s total rent.\nOur analysis found a dramatic difference between ownership and rental costs. We estimate that the average renter of a $75,000 single-family home pays about $227 more a month than it would cost to own the property. And the average renter of a $50,000 home pays $360 more per month than it would cost an owner with normal expenses.\nGosman said there is huge demand from working families to fix up and purchase homes, but he acknowledged there are challenges that must be overcome.\nPhoebe Alexander, whom we met earlier, knows those challenges first-hand.\n“I always wanted to buy a house,” she said. “But we knew there were some things in our past that we needed to clean up financially. We kept asking ourselves, how are we going to do this?”\nThe Alexanders had gotten into financial trouble when Phoebe had not one, but two jobs eliminated through corporate downsizing. While she said the purchase price for their northwest side duplex was “very reasonable,” the property required more than $30,000 in repairs. The couple also needed a down payment.\nIt took nearly five years of working with Acts Housing for the Alexanders to repair their credit history, save money, and become eligible for financing. Finally, in July 2019, the Alexanders’ perseverance paid off. They closed on their property. Now in their 50s, with steady jobs, the family is living their version of the American Dream.\nGosman told us that the Alexanders’ story illustrates the obstacles that often stand in the way of ownership. Families may have debt and credit issues or not enough money for a down payment. That can discourage institutions from lending. Other families are simply living on the margins. Previous Lubar Center reporting found median income for Black households in Milwaukee is just $30,000 a year.\nStill, Gosman said many issues can be resolved through financial counseling. Of his organization’s 100 outstanding loans, only 1% are delinquent, even during the pandemic.\nBut the growing presence of out-of-state investors has created another challenge.\n“This is the most competitive market for low- and moderately-priced homes that our organization has ever seen,” he said. “It means that every single additional entrant in the market is competition for our families, who are not in a position to make cash offers.”\nOur analysis did not look at the impact of these purchases on Milwaukee neighborhood values or at how properties are maintained. On their websites, the investment groups say they are meeting a need for single-family rental housing.\nBut at last fall’s housing program at the Lubar Center, Milwaukee Common Council President Cavalier Johnson expressed concern that out-of-state ownership can make it harder to address issues with a troubled property. “That ultimately affects the stability and cohesiveness of neighborhoods, and that’s trouble,” Johnson said.\nCity Development Commissioner Lafayette Crump told us that Milwaukee is not alone in seeing a growing number of out-of-state landlords. With interest rates at historically low levels, he said individuals are seeking alternatives for investment.\nCrump said that out-of-state landlords and investment funds still own only about 5% of the city’s single-family homes and duplexes. He said the increased out-of-state investment is “worth keeping an eye on but not necessarily a cause for alarm at the moment.\n“We do believe local ownership is important and that people who live in and have a vested interest in the city are more likely to do a good job of being responsible owners,” Crump said.\n“We do not want to cede portions of the city to external investors or control.”\nThe city is taking steps to increase and maintain owner-occupancy, Crump noted. That includes working with local partners, including emerging developers and nonprofits, to provide city-owned properties, financial resources, and support for the development of one- and two-family properties. Some will eventually be turned over to homeownership.\nCrump said that when the city sells properties, preference is given to owner-occupiers. It is about to launch a pilot program that does the same for existing city homeowners interested in buying properties near their home.\nCrump said Mayor Tom Barrett’s 2021 budget also includes a new down payment assistance program. “Our goals in this area are not only to increase owner occupancy, but to preserve it,” Crump added.\nGosman’s organization hopes to help 220 more families purchase homes this year and plans to lend an additional $2 million, almost doubling its portfolio. Still, creating awareness of what is possible remains a challenge.\n“The biggest obstacle is that people just don’t believe that homeownership can be for people like them,” Gosman explained.\nPhoebe Alexander agreed.\n“I think there are more people out there that would love to own homes, but they need help in getting started,” she said.\nAs she described her home’s most recent improvements, Alexander’s excitement spoke to one of the key differences between local and long-distance home ownership. For her, it’s more than just a financial investment. It’s personal.\n“I told my husband I don’t want anything for Christmas because I’ve got my stainless-steel sink,” she said. “You can make a house your own. That’s what I love about it. When I turn the key, I’m turning the key to my home.”"

Still, Milwaukee’s 2022 turnout remained higher than any other race for governor from 1974 through 2006.\nOver the past decade, turnout dropped sharply in Milwaukee’s majority black neighborhoods, but it fell from remarkably high levels during the Obama years.\nThe sky-high turnout in majority Black wards during the Obama administration also extended to midterm elections–not just when Obama himself was on the ballot. This bump in turnout may have been thanks to renewed enthusiasm for the Democratic party, a strong get-out-the-vote operation, or something else, but it clearly extended beyond just support for the man himself. Whatever the cause, it appears to be over now, as turnout in majority Black wards has dropped relative to the rest of the city in each of the last 2 presidential and gubernatorial elections."

In 2022, it was most common in the wards near Marquette and UWM.\nVoting by mail was relatively uncommon until 2020, when the pandemic caused it to be the single most popular way to cast a ballot. The third of voters who continued to cast a ballot this way in 2022 were not evenly spread out across the city. Instead, mail-in voting was most common in the neighborhoods hugging the lake and on the periphery of the city. It was least popular in many near south side wards.\nThe popularity of voting early, in person has waxed and waned around the city–perhaps following the availability of early voting locations. In 2012, it was popular downtown and across much of the east and north sides. Fewer votes were cast this way in 2014, but its popularity spiked again in 2016. In recent years, in-person early voting has been most popular in a section of the north side, roughly centered on the intersection of Capitol Drive and Fond du Lac Avenue.\n\ne-day registrantsearly, by mailearly, in-person"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The following analysis is based on unofficial election night returns.\nThe election results from the Milwaukee metro reveal the breadth of Janet Protasiewicz’s landslide victory in the 2023 WI Supreme Court election. Liberal candidates (Protasiewicz and Everett) won the 4-county area by 2.6 points (51.3% of the two-party vote) during the February primary. Protasiewicz won the general election by 12.1 points in the 4 counties.\nIn Milwaukee County, Protasiewicz increased the liberal share of the (two-party) vote from 68% in the primary to 73% in the general. In Ozaukee County, she improved from 44% in the primary to 48% in the general. In Waukesha County, she moved from 36% in the primary to 42% in the general. And in more-Republican Washington County she likewise improved from 29% in the primary to 34% in the general election.\nProtasiewicz improved her vote share in all but two of the metro’s 94 municipalities. The graphs below show each municipality’s primary and general election vote margins. (Vote totals are tabulated separately for the handful of municipalities that straddle county lines.)\nThe liberal candidate flipped 9 municipalities which had given a majority of their vote to the conservative candidates in the primary. They are Greendale, Oak Creek, Port Washington, Cedarburg, Thiensville, Mequon, Hales Corners, Franklin, and Waukesha. Among these, the City of Waukesha saw the largest shift. It gave liberal candidates 41% of the vote in February, while Protasiewicz won just over 50% in April.\n\n\n\nElection results are reported in combinations of wards called “reporting units” for many of the smaller municipalities in Wisconsin. The following maps show the SCOWIS results in those units. The last map shows the shift in reporting units between the primary and the general election for those places where a direct comparison was possible.\nAmong municipalities where at least 1,000 votes were cast, the largest shifts came in the Town of Brookfield (+10 points toward Protasiewicz), the City of Waukesha (+9), West Allis (+8), and the Village of Germantown (+8).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides the Supreme Court race, the special election to fill the 8th Senate District also drew much attention. This traditionally Republican seat mainly covers a set of northern suburbs which have trended toward the Democrats in recent years. Protasiewicz actually carried a narrow majority of this district, but the Democratic candidate, Jodi Habush Sinykin, fell just short. Protasiewicz received 38,470 votes, equal to 50.7% of the total in that race. Habush Sinykin won 37,208, or 49.1%.\n\nThe table below shows Supreme Court results for each municipality (within counties).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the map below to explore specific results in each reporting unit."

    "text": "A small woman with a warm smile and wry sense of humor, 46-year-old Nang Kham arrived in Milwaukee more than a decade ago, a refugee from a place halfway around the world. Kham was born in Burma, the southeast Asian country also known as Myanmar. The daughter of a Burmese politician and a nurse, political turmoil in her country had forced her family to flee to a refugee camp on the border between Burma and Thailand.\n“We lived in a tent,” Kham recalled. Food was rationed and water was scarce. Travel outside the camp was not allowed. No one had a job.\nKham applied for refugee status and in 2007 she was allowed to come to the United States. She initially settled in southern California. Her parents remained behind to help others at the refugee camp.\n“I came here alone,” Kham told us. “It was scary.”\nAfter living in California for three years, she moved to Milwaukee in 2010. Her brother, also a refugee, had moved here the year before. Three months after her arrival, Kham had her first job, making sandwiches at Subway. Kham chuckled as she remembered that time. “I don’t know, what is salami, what is pepperoni?”\nBut unlike many of her fellow refugees, Kham spoke English as well as two different languages common in Burma. She began working as an interpreter, and then spent six years at Neighborhood House as a bilingual assistant.\nToday, she is a realtor. Because of her language skills, the close-knit Burmese community asked her to get a real estate license, so she could help the newcomers become homeowners. Kham agreed, eager to make a difference. She said Milwaukee’s Burmese community is growing, attracting even those who first settled in other American cities.\n“The first thing is, it’s easier to find a job, to get around town, go shopping, go to work,” Kham explained. She said she is much happier in Milwaukee than she was in California.\n“I think Milwaukee is the best, compared to the other states.”"

    "section": "Share of immigrant population in Milwaukee lagging",
    "text": "Share of immigrant population in Milwaukee lagging\nMilwaukee’s history with immigration is long and rich. The 1850 census— the first after Wisconsin achieved statehood— found that 55% of the population was born outside the U.S. While America was still a young country at the time, Milwaukee’s experience was hardly the norm. Nationwide, about 10% of residents were foreign born.\nToday, the census estimates that roughly 119,000 immigrants live in the four-county Milwaukee metropolitan area, and there are 47,000 kids being raised by at least one immigrant parent. The number of Milwaukee area residents born outside the country is now double that of 1980.\nBut those facts overshadow another important truth, one with major implications for our region. The share of the immigrant population in metro Milwaukee is now barely half that of the nation. In 2022, about 14% of Americans were born outside the U.S., compared to fewer than 8% of those living in our area. And that raises an important question; could attracting more immigrants help address two of our region’s serious challenges: stagnant population growth and a rapidly aging workforce?\nAt first glance, this may not seem like the right time for a conversation about greater immigration in metro Milwaukee. Social services in some cities, including Chicago and New York, are currently overwhelmed by record numbers of asylum seekers arriving from the southern border. On Capitol Hill, comprehensive immigration reform remains a pipedream.\nGiven that backdrop, it is important to clarify the sources of immigration. Asylum seekers mostly arrive in the country without existing connections, and they are generally prevented by federal law from working for at least six months after filing their applications. As Chicago’s experience shows, resolving this situation will require concerted federal action. Cities cannot go it alone.\nStill, most immigrants arrive through more standard forms of legal immigration, which is largely based on family relationships and targeted work skills. Another common source, especially in Milwaukee, is refugee resettlement where vetted individuals and families are already paired with support from community groups before arriving. These forms of legal immigration present a potential opportunity for Milwaukee. Immigration totals in the U.S. are climbing again. The census estimates that last year the number of people born outside the U.S. grew by nearly 1 million to more than 46 million.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported recently that the historic rise in immigration is the result of the U.S. catching up on a backlog of visa applications and the Biden administration accelerating work permits. The result, the paper noted, has been a boost to the U.S. economy, as labor shortages and wage and price pressures ease.\nThe newcomers—the majority of whom are here legally—work in a wide range of jobs: in restaurants and hotels, on production lines and dairy farms, in the technology sector, and on university campuses. While many begin their lives in America in big cities like New York, Chicago, and Houston, they often migrate to mid-sized cities and their suburbs. Should Milwaukee be one of them?"

    "text": "Where do immigrants hail from? Answer might surprise you.\nMost immigrants arrived in metro Milwaukee in two waves: before the 1920s and after the 1960s. The 40-year gap in significant immigration was largely the result of federal legislation that sharply curtailed the number of people allowed into the country.\nImmigration here reached its peak in the 1880s, fueling the city’s rapid population growth. By 1910, Milwaukee had become the 12th largest American city (we are now 31st), a place known for its industrial and political innovation. Approximately six out of every 1,000 American residents lived in the area. In contrast, roughly 11 out of every 1,000 foreign-born residents in the U.S. lived here.\nBut the city did not remain a magnet for immigrants. After 1970, immigration to the U.S. began to soar, but not in metro Milwaukee, where the share of the foreign-born population fell to less than 4% in 1990, an all-time low. Since then, the immigrant share of metro Milwaukee’s population has risen steadily but remains less than cities like Columbus, Ohio, Rockford, Illinois, and Des Moines, Iowa.\nThe face of immigration in metro Milwaukee has changed considerably over time. In its first century, the newcomers were largely from Europe, with German and Polish immigrants leading the way. In 1900, fully 64% of immigrants living in the metro hailed from Germany, followed by 15% from Poland.\nToday, immigrants come from around the world. Mexico provides the largest share at 31%. Those 36,000 Mexican immigrants are joined by about 2,600 from Central American nations, 3,900 from South America, and 3,000 from the Caribbean. All told, about 46,000 Milwaukee metro residents are from Latin America — 39% of all immigrants. These statistics do not include Puerto Ricans, because they are not foreign-born. It is worth noting that the same census data estimates 15,000 current metro Milwaukee residents were born in Puerto Rico.\nLatin Americans may make up the largest group of immigrants to Milwaukee, but the Latin American immigrant population share is still less than half the national average.\nThe other primary source of immigrants to our area is Asia. Most come from the south central or southeastern parts of the continent. They constitute 38% of immigrants to metro Milwaukee, or an estimated 44,000 residents.\nThe largest number of Asian immigrants were born in India, about 12,700 residents. They represent 11% of the metro’s total immigrant population.\nMetro Milwaukee is also home to 5,900 Chinese immigrants. But the Chinese-born population here is far below the national average, while the percentage of Indian immigrants in metro Milwaukee is similar to the national average.\nWhile their numbers are smaller, four southeast Asian countries —Burma or Myanmar, Laos, Malaysia, and Thailand — contribute far more immigrants to the Milwaukee metro than is typically found in the rest of the U.S.\nWell over a century ago, Europeans flocked to Milwaukee in large numbers. Today, 16% of the immigrants in the area, or approximately 19,000, were born in a European country. They come mainly from Eastern Europe, but in a nod to Milwaukee’s past, the largest single source of European immigrants is still Germany. About 3,400 German-born residents live here.\nOnly about 6% of area immigrants, or roughly 6,600 residents, are from African nations. Milwaukee’s share of African immigrants is about 44% smaller than the national average.\nEven though metro Milwaukee lags the nation in terms of overall immigration, the metro has held its own when it comes to refugee settlement, with the pace picking up during the past decade. During the 1990s, refugees most often came from the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. More recently, the most common country of origin has been Burma, or Myanmar. By 2018, the metro had resettled about 5,300 refugees from Burma. The peak year was 2016, when more than 1,400 refugees arrived."

    "section": "Cities with strong economies have growing immigrant populations",
    "text": "Cities with strong economies have growing immigrant populations\nWhy do these numbers matter, especially in a place like Milwaukee?\nA 2021 analysis produced by the Brookings Institution noted that “cities with the fastest growing immigrant populations over the period 2010-2019 were all medium-sized cities with thriving economies, led by Charleston, South Carolina, Des Moines, Iowa, Louisville, Kentucky, Columbus, Ohio, and Nashville, Tennessee.”\nIn many of these cases, the analysis stated, “immigrants reversed long-standing population declines. More important, immigrants’ high rates of entrepreneurship and labor force participation helped boost local economies that had been stagnant for decades.”\nA 2022 study published by the George W. Bush Institute at Southern Methodist University found that metros and counties with relatively large immigrant population shares performed better in household income, innovation, overall productivity, and startup businesses. “Cities that succeed best in attracting newcomers — immigrant and native-born alike—and creating conditions for them to thrive will likely achieve outsized prosperity in coming decades, as they have always done,” the report concluded.\nThere is no secret sauce to population growth. Metros grow in one of three ways. They have more births than deaths. More Americans move to a place than away from it, or what is called domestic migration. And finally, there is international immigration.\nFrom 2010-2019, immigration accounted for 44% of Wisconsin’s population growth. Nearly half of the immigrants moved to metro Milwaukee. And yet, the four-county area’s population only grew by about 19,000 residents over the past decade.\nOur sluggish population growth has been the result of declining birthrates and people leaving. In fact, without the influx of immigrants, the metro’s population would have shrunk considerably, with serious implications for the region’s economy.\nTo our northwest, immigrants are playing an increasing role in the Minneapolis metro and Minnesota economies, which face some of the same workforce challenges seen in Milwaukee and Wisconsin. Recent census data now estimates that 11% of the residents in the Minneapolis metro are foreign-born, or 399,000 people. Again, in Milwaukee, 8% were born outside the U.S. If immigrants came to the Milwaukee metro in the same proportion as they do Minneapolis, our population would be 55,000 larger. Keep in mind, the rate of immigration in the Minneapolis metro is still less than the national average.\nThe Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development highlighted the importance of the region’s newcomers to the area’s economy in a recent report. “Wherever they work,” the report concluded, “these new Minnesotans are a vital part of the state and region’s economy, providing rapid growth to an otherwise aging and slowing labor force. “\nSeveral factors, including economic opportunity, existing immigrant communities, housing costs, and good schools, play a role in where immigrants choose to live. But so does public policy, which can make a metro more welcoming to new arrivals. For example, the city of Minneapolis has created an office for immigrants and refugee affairs to help make immigrants’ transition to their new home smoother.\nBuffalo offers another example of intentional outreach. In 2015, Buffalo launched the Office of New Americans to serve its growing refugee and immigrant communities. According to the city’s website, the office’s mission is “to promote access to city services, area resources and to implement policies that facilitate the successful integration of newcomers into the civic, economic, and cultural life of Buffalo.”\nWhat does that mission look like in practice? In September, Buffalo’s mayor announced a program to reduce language barriers for new arrivals, with city communications in the six most common languages spoken in Buffalo, besides English: Spanish, Arabic, Bengali, Burmese, Karen, and Swahili.\nThere have been efforts to do something similar in Milwaukee. In 2021, the city requested bids to create the Milwaukee Immigrant and Refugee Welcome Center. “It was evident that there is no single point of access to services for new arrivals to get information on services available, “the request explained. “Even when newcomers know about different services available, connecting them can be difficult, due to barriers such as language, transportation and childcare.”\nTwo years later, the welcome center has yet to materialize. But in response to a question, Mayor Cavalier Johnson said the city remains interested in developing one, with support from private sector partners.\nUsing a variety of metrics, the Bush Institute report ranked cities where immigrants were “thriving best.” Some of the places where foreign-born residents were faring well were not surprising. They included tech hubs like San Jose, San Francisco, and Seattle. But the report found that immigrants also thrived in metros like Baltimore, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, and Cincinnati and noted that a number of the cities had enacted explicit welcoming policies for immigrants. Metro Milwaukee finished in the middle of the 100 metros that were ranked.\nRecent census data puts the median income of an immigrant household in Wisconsin at about 94% that of native-born households. Outcomes tend to improve the longer immigrants live here. For instance, when Hmong refugees began arriving in Wisconsin in the 1970s and 1980s, many were poor. In 1990, the average Hmong immigrant’s household income was just 39% of the state average. Our analysis of the most recent census data found that the median household income for Hmong immigrants now exceeds the state average.\nMayor Johnson, who has set has set an ambitious goal for population growth, called Milwaukee a welcoming community for immigrants, with the city’s block grant agency investing in church and community agency efforts to help those who settle here. He also said the city needs more immigrants to grow its population and economy.\n“Ultimately, Milwaukee welcomes immigrants who are looking to make their lives here, who want their families to grow here, and who want to be hardworking additions to our local economy,” Johnson said. “That is a tradition that has served Milwaukee well for more than 175 years.”\nJohnson said Milwaukee has largely avoided the rancorous debates over asylum seekers and said it is up to states and federal governments to create “sensible and reasonable” policies to address the issue.\nIn today’s highly charged political environment, even having a conversation about greater immigration is likely to produce opposition. Our metro has pockets of deep poverty and there are serious resource questions that would need to be answered. It is also possible that more restrictive immigration policies could return depending on future election outcomes.\nBut the public still views immigration in a favorable light. In a national Gallup poll conducted in June of this year, 68% of those surveyed said that immigration is a good thing for the country today. Just 27% said it was a bad thing.\nTalk to an immigrant family, and you often hear of the struggle. The challenge of finding adequate housing. Of learning a new language. Of adapting to a new culture. Nang Kham described the transition of her fellow Burmese refugees, as “very hard.”\nStill, she said most in her community have found jobs. They are buying houses and, like Kham, becoming U.S. citizens. Kham even helped her community purchase two churches so they would have places to worship, one at 24th and State in Milwaukee and another in Brown Deer.\nKham smiled wistfully as she talked about her former home, Burma, or Myanmar. She said she still thinks about it often. But just like the Germans and Poles who came before her, she has built a new life in Milwaukee.\n“To be an American dream,” she said, “you have to risk a lot.”"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Lots of people want to live in Washington Heights—the Milwaukee neighborhood sandwiched between Washington Park to the east and Wauwatosa to the west. The median home price grew by $92,000 (53%) from 2019 to 2023, nearly double the citywide increase of $48,000.1 Average rents grew by 16% in the past two years alone, double the national increase of 8%.2\nDespite this, Washington Heights is shrinking. The neighborhood’s population fell from 7,200 in 2000 to 6,741 in 2010 and 6,360 in 2020. That is a 12% drop in 20 years.\nThe reasons are not complicated. The number of households has stayed about the same, but the average household size has fallen from 2.47 in 2000 to 2.36 in 2010 and 2.22 in 2020. Families are having fewer children, and more adults are living alone.\nImagine a typical block with 32 single-family homes (16 lots on each side of the street). In 2000, that block had 79 residents, it had 76 in 2010, and 71 in 2020. Across many blocks, these small changes add up quickly.\nMilwaukee’s lack of affordable, quality housing for low income residents is a central focus among local policymakers, funders, and nonprofits. The situation in Washington Heights, a solidly middle class neighborhood, points to a different, but related dilemma. Even in neighborhoods where would-be residents can afford the cost to build new housing, adequate supply simply doesn’t exist, and current land use regulations inhibit its construction.\nThis lack of supply has cascading effects. Equity from rapidly increasing home values may please existing homeowners, but it also saddles them with higher property taxes. The long term decline in the number of adult residents means fewer people are responsible for funding the same amount of infrastructure. People who are priced out of buying or renting in one neighborhood instead turn to a cheaper one, repeating the same pattern of displacement at a lower income bracket.\nWashington Heights’ housing stock today is little changed from the early 20th century. Only 6 houses have been built in the neighborhood since 1960 (likely replacing older houses). Meanwhile, the net number of housing units has slowly shrunk. Since 1990, the neighborhood has lost 45 units, thanks to duplexes being downgraded to single family homes.3 (Only 3 single family homes have been converted to duplexes.)4\nLooking further back, the change is even more astonishing. Milwaukee’s population hit its peak in 1960, when 741,000 people lived within city limits. To compare how neighborhoods have changed since then, I matched 2020 census blocks with the larger 1960 census tracts.\nSee the bottom of this post for an interactive map showing this data across the entire city.\nConsider the greater Washington Heights area, outlined in blue on the map below. (1960 tracts rarely exactly match current neighborhood boundaries.) This area had a 1960 population of 15,635 people living in households.5 That fell by 31%, to about 10,800 in 2020. The average household size fell from 2.9 to 2.2. The number of children declined by nearly 2,000 and the number of adults by 2,900.\nIn other words, about 4,800 fewer people live within immediate walking distance of the historic commercial corridors along Vliet Street, North Avenue, and (at the time) Lloyd Street. And these commercial districts have changed too. Along Vliet, Lloyd, and North, just between 47th Street and 60th, there were 12 food stores in 1960 (including corner stores & butchers) along with: 7 bakeries, 6 pharmacies, 10 taverns, 5 restaurants, 2 hardware stores, and dozens of other retail stores or service providers.6\nThe number of restaurants along Vliet and North has more than doubled since 1960, and the number of taverns has held mostly steady. But other kinds of retail have vanished. No bakeries and only two food retailers remain. There are no hardware stores and only one small pharmacy.\nNeighborhood grocery stores have been replaced by large supermarkets surrounded by parking lots across the country. In some measure, this reflects changing consumer preferences. But the decline in foot traffic along Milwaukee’s old neighborhood “downtowns” has also contributed to their diminished retail offerings. The commercial corridors in Milwaukee’s older neighborhoods were built without parking lots in an era when thousands more people lived within walking distance.\nThe story of Washington Heights is common across Milwaukee. As I’ve previously written, about 40% of the city is in “stable decline,” characterized by high occupancy rates but shrinking populations due to declining household sizes.\nConsider the portion of Bay View north of Oklahoma Avenue. These tracts have lost 5,600 residents since 1960. It would take nearly 3,500 more housing units to restore the population of 60 years ago, given current household sizes. That is despite the fact that Bay View has built more housing. The number of units has grown by more than 700 since 1960. Without that, the neighborhood’s population would have plummeted by perhaps another 1,200 residents.7\nSome neighborhoods have built enough new housing to stave off the post-1960 housing collapse, and their historic commercial districts reflect that.\nThe two census tracts on the east side between North Avenue and Park Place are good examples of this approach. Together, they have added 1,600 net new housing units since 1960. This has allowed the neighborhood’s overall population to remain steady despite the average household size falling.8\nSmall wonder then, that the neighborhood has sustained a genuinely comprehensive commercial district. The area around Downer Avenue includes a full grocery store, a bakery, hardware store, pharmacy, dry cleaner, and multiple medical providers.\nMuch of Milwaukee’s east side benefits from zoning rules that permit multi-family developments, whether apartment buildings or condos. Over 70% of the post-1960 construction in the two tracts near Downer Avenue occurred in parcels with high-density zoning classifications.\nOther neighborhoods, like Walker’s Point and parts of Bay View have successfully converted former industrial land and buildings into new housing. A current example is the redevelopment of the Filer and Stowell complex, which plans to build 576 new units across eight apartment buildings.\nDowntown Milwaukee has added a great deal of housing, often by converting old office buildings. An ongoing effort to redevelop the previously foreclosed 100 East building could create 350 apartments across its 35 stories.\nNone of these kinds of construction are an option for neighborhoods like Washington Heights. Unlike the east side, Washington Heights has no parcels zoned for high density development. Unlike Bay View or Downtown, Washington Heights was built as a purely residential neighborhood, so it doesn’t have legacy industrial sites or underused office buildings.\nWashington Heights has also seen few home demolitions, so it mostly lacks the large (or adjacent) empty lots necessary to build townhomes. In short, there are few existing options for restoring the historic population density to neighborhoods like this.\nThe city’s new draft zoning reform plan, Growing MKE, proposes a set of changes to make growing the housing supply in places like Washington Heights more possible.\nIf adopted, the plan would change the kinds of housing which can be built under the city’s various residential zoning classes. All residential zones would permit the construction of single-family homes, accessory dwelling units, townhomes, duplexes, triplexes, and cottage courts. Those areas already zoned for duplexes (a substantial portion of the city) would also allow 3 and 4-unit buildings. Another provision would make it easier to build apartment buildings on lots already zoned for them.\nLooking at the city as a whole, the most consequential aspects of Growing MKE are likely the provisions that encourage new multi-unit developments, from townhouses and cottage courts to quadplexes and small apartment buildings. These have the potential to grow the city’s housing stock the most.\nHowever, accessory dwelling units (ADUs) are the aspect of the Growing MKE plan most relevant to a neighborhood like Washington Heights. Most parcels in the neighborhood include a backyard with a garage that could be replaced with, or modified to include, a small house.\nThese kinds of small backlot houses are common in Milwaukee’s older neighborhoods, where they are often called “carriage houses.” Other houses with large basements could be converted to include an “internal ADU.”\nThere are about 2,000 houses in Washington Heights. Half of their owners have held them for 8 years or more. Given the rapid increase in home values, many residents have accumulated significant equity in their homes, which could be used to finance ADU construction.9\nADU construction tends to grow quickly in cities after the rules are changed to encourage them. Still, it’s not an overwhelming flood. In 2023, Seattle issued permits for 987 ADUs, up from 246 in 2018 (prior to reforms passed in 2019).\nThese numbers may seem low compared to the massive need for housing, but new construction is currently even more rare. Fewer than 150 single family homes or duplexes were built in Milwaukee in the last 4 years combined.10\nWhat would it take for Washington Heights to stop shrinking? At the current pace, households are shrinking by about 0.1 persons per decade. Put differently, every 10 years, each 10 houses lose 1 resident. There are about 2,900 households in Washington Heights. At that pace of change, the neighborhood will lose about 290 more residents by 2030. Avoiding that loss would require building around 140 more units.11\nThe zoning reforms proposed in the Growing MKE plan are intended to encourage property owners in the city to build more housing on their own. This will likely mainly happen in the parts of the city which are already relatively prosperous.\nFor the half of Milwaukee renters who spend more than 30% of their income on rent (and the quarter who spend 50% or more), market solutions alone are unlikely to build a sufficient quantity of actually affordable housing. But encouraging new housing construction in the parts of the city where the market will fund it is a crucial way for the city to create more options for property owners and renters alike, while also expanding its tax base.\nBy allowing the market to build housing in places where existing demand will pay for it, the city can better steer its resources toward subsidizing housing development in the neighborhoods of Milwaukee where the need is dire but the market will not provide it."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The official census count occurs just once every ten years, and it’s out of date by the time it gets released.\nThe last census was officially conducted on April 1, 2020, so it missed essentially all the population changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. But each year, the U.S. Census Bureau also releases “intercensal” population estimates. These are based on carefully collected administrative records (births, deaths, tax returns, etc.), and they give us the best look at how our current population is changing. The estimates cover 12-month periods beginning on July 1. The latest data covers the year from July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023.\nThe pandemic and its aftermath is still the big story in this data. Cities across the country shrank. Some, like Detroit, have begun to grow. Despite Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson’s well-publicized goal of “1 million Milwaukeeans,” the city’s population recovery has yet to begin.\nThe latest estimates show positive signs for Wisconsin, but continued struggles for Milwaukee, relative to our midwestern peers. Wisconsin has largely returned to pre-pandemic form, while Milwaukee County is continuing to shrink at twice the rate of the 2010s.\nWisconsin added 20,000 net new residents from July 2022 to July 2023, a growth rate of 0.35%, which is practically identical to the state’s average growth rate during the previous decade. That growth was nearly double the state’s increase of 11,000 in 2022, which came on the heels of a 17,000-person loss in the first year of the pandemic.\nPopulation change can be broken down into two components — net migration and natural change (births minus deaths). The next graph shows why each state grew or shrank over the past three years. Wisconsin’s 2023 growth rate falls below Minnesota and Indiana but above Michigan and Iowa. Illinois is still shrinking badly.\n\n\n\nEach state has followed a different trajectory.\n\nWisconsin had slightly more deaths than births in 2021 and 2022, before flipping to slightly more births in 2023. The bigger change has come from improving migration numbers. The state lost 16,000 net migrants in 2021 but gained 15,000 in 2022 and 19,000 in 2023.\nMichigan has followed a similar trajectory as Wisconsin, but with more negative natural increase and slightly less migration.\nMinnesota’s net migration has bounced around over the past few years, but its strong birth rates have kept it from shrinking much.\nIowa is close to flat—but slightly positive—in both natural change and net migration.\nIllinois has maintained slightly positive natural change, but it gets hammered on net migration. A net of more than 100,000 people left the state in both 2021 and 2022. The outbound tide slowed to 43,000 in 2023, but Illinois remains the only state in this set to have negative net migration.\nIndiana has attracted more than 20,000 net new residents in each of the past 3 years—some of them, doubtlessly, former Illinoisans.\n\nMilwaukee County’s population fell by an estimated 1,800 during the 12-month period ending July 2023. That was an improvement over the previous two years, when the population fell by 6,200 and 14,300, respectively. Still, the county shrank by 0.2% in 2023, compared with an average annual decline of less than 0.1% throughout the 2010s.\nThe maps below show components of population change for each county.\n\n\n\nThe strongest position is in the top left map, which shows counties with more births than deaths and positive net migration. It includes the counties surrounding Indianapolis and the Twin Cities—though notably not any of those cities themselves. The growth emanating (though not shared by) the Twin Cities is so strong that it reaches as far as Eau Claire, Wis. Other areas in Wisconsin in this strong position include Dane and Marathon counties, the Fox Valley, and the greater La Crosse area.\nOnly a handful of counties have negative migration but enough of a positive birth rate to keep growing nonetheless. The largest in this category is Hennepin County, home to Minneapolis. In Wisconsin, they include Clark, Lafayette, and Trempealeau counties.\nMany more counties have aging populations, resulting in negative natural change, but enough in-migration to create population growth. Broadly speaking, this includes a great swathe across northern Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. Perhaps the remote work boom is finally creating the conditions for population growth across the Northwoods.\nIf the healthiest counties grow from births and migration, then the most troubled counties are shrinking for both reasons. These counties — which have more deaths than births and more leavers than comers — are found most commonly in rural Illinois and Iowa. In Wisconsin they include just Columbia, Crawford, Juneau, and Jackson counties.\nSeven of the region’s largest 10 counties fall into the next category — where natural change is positive, but offset by out-migration. To put it reductively, people seem to have kids in these counties, then they leave. This status includes Milwaukee County; Cook, Kenosha, Lake, and DuPage counties in the Chicago metro; Wayne and Oakland counties in the Detroit metro; and Marion County (containing Indianapolis).\nThe final category, positive migration but an even larger negative natural change, occurs mainly in rural counties — particularly in Illinois.\nThe Census Bureau further estimates municipality population by tracking new housing unit construction and allocating the county-level population estimate into each town based on the average household size in the 2020 census. Based on this methodology, Milwaukee city’s population fell by 2,200 in 2023 to a new low of 561,400. The most significant growth came in Oak Creek, which likely added about 1,100 new residents. Most of the remaining municipalities are estimated to have shrunk slightly.\nMilwaukee’s decline of 2,200 is an improvement over its loss of 2,900 in 2022 and pandemic-fueled drop of over 10,000 in 2021. But Milwaukee’s rate of decline in 2023 was still tied with Rockford, Ill., for the worst among the region’s 15 largest cities.\nMilwaukee’s rate of change since the 2020 census is second-worst, trailing only Chicago. Madison, on the other hand, had the highest rate of growth in 2023 and the second highest since the pandemic (after Fort Wayne).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent population change\n\n\namong the 15 largest cities in MN, IA, WI, IL, MI, & IN\n\n\n\ncensus 2020\ncensus to 7/1/2023\nyear ending 7/1/2023\n\n\npop.\npct.\npop.\npct.\n\n\n\n\nChicago city\n2,746,352\n−81,900\n−3.0%\n−8,208\n−0.3%\n\n\nIndianapolis city (balance)\n887,648\n−8,355\n−0.9%\n−1,104\n−0.1%\n\n\nDetroit city\n639,475\n−6,257\n−1.0%\n1,852\n0.3%\n\n\nMilwaukee city\n577,893\n−16,508\n−2.9%\n−2,247\n−0.4%\n\n\nMinneapolis city\n429,988\n−4,873\n−1.1%\n3,112\n0.7%\n\n\nSt. Paul city\n311,516\n−7,696\n−2.5%\n−616\n−0.2%\n\n\nMadison city\n274,644\n5,661\n2.1%\n2,891\n1.0%\n\n\nFort Wayne city\n263,909\n6,085\n2.3%\n1,927\n0.7%\n\n\nDes Moines city\n214,124\n−3,743\n−1.7%\n−667\n−0.3%\n\n\nGrand Rapids city\n198,890\n−2,282\n−1.1%\n−584\n−0.3%\n\n\nAurora city\n180,530\n−2,967\n−1.6%\n−368\n−0.2%\n\n\nJoliet city\n150,393\n96\n0.1%\n333\n0.2%\n\n\nNaperville city\n149,551\n694\n0.5%\n221\n0.1%\n\n\nRockford city\n148,924\n−2,804\n−1.9%\n−526\n−0.4%\n\n\nWarren city\n139,397\n−2,742\n−2.0%\n−470\n−0.3%\n\n\n\nPopulation estimates from the Census Bureau's population estimates program, vintage 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the 15 largest municipalities in Wisconsin have shrunk since the 2020 census, with the exceptions of Madison, Eau Claire, and Janesville.

The bright spots in Wisconsin extend well beyond Madison. Many regions surrounding smaller cities like Eau Claire, Wausau, and the Fox Valley are doing quite well. The rural Northwoods is attracting enough migration to offset the natural decline of its aging population. Our rural communities are in a much healthier place than those of Illinois or Iowa.\nStill, even if Wisconsin’s outlook seems better than Illinois’, Milwaukee nonetheless appears to be on the same trajectory as Chicago. In both, the population has fallen by about 3% since the pandemic began. The culprit is the same. The birth rate in each city is positive, but more people choose to move away than to move in."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Lots of people want to live in Washington Heights—the Milwaukee neighborhood sandwiched between Washington Park to the east and Wauwatosa to the west. The median home price grew by $92,000 (53%) from 2019 to 2023, nearly double the citywide increase of $48,000.1 Average rents grew by 16% in the past two years alone, double the national increase of 8%.2\nDespite this, Washington Heights is shrinking. The neighborhood’s population fell from 7,200 in 2000 to 6,741 in 2010 and 6,360 in 2020. That is a 12% drop in 20 years.\nThe reasons are not complicated. The number of households has stayed about the same, but the average household size has fallen from 2.47 in 2000 to 2.36 in 2010 and 2.22 in 2020. Families are having fewer children, and more adults are living alone.\nImagine a typical block with 32 single-family homes (16 lots on each side of the street). In 2000, that block had 79 residents, it had 76 in 2010, and 71 in 2020. Across many blocks, these small changes add up quickly.\nMilwaukee’s lack of affordable, quality housing for low income residents is a central focus among local policymakers, funders, and nonprofits. The situation in Washington Heights, a solidly middle class neighborhood, points to a different, but related dilemma. Even in neighborhoods where would-be residents can afford the cost to build new housing, adequate supply simply doesn’t exist, and current land use regulations inhibit its construction.\nThis lack of supply has cascading effects. Equity from rapidly increasing home values may please existing homeowners, but it also saddles them with higher property taxes. The long term decline in the number of adult residents means fewer people are responsible for funding the same amount of infrastructure. People who are priced out of buying or renting in one neighborhood instead turn to a cheaper one, repeating the same pattern of displacement at a lower income bracket.\nWashington Heights’ housing stock today is little changed from the early 20th century. Only 6 houses have been built in the neighborhood since 1960 (likely replacing older houses). Meanwhile, the net number of housing units has slowly shrunk. Since 1990, the neighborhood has lost 45 units, thanks to duplexes being downgraded to single family homes.3 (Only 3 single family homes have been converted to duplexes.)4\nLooking further back, the change is even more astonishing. Milwaukee’s population hit its peak in 1960, when 741,000 people lived within city limits. To compare how neighborhoods have changed since then, I matched 2020 census blocks with the larger 1960 census tracts.\nSee the bottom of this post for an interactive map showing this data across the entire city.\nConsider the greater Washington Heights area, outlined in blue on the map below. (1960 tracts rarely exactly match current neighborhood boundaries.) This area had a 1960 population of 15,635 people living in households.5 That fell by 31%, to about 10,800 in 2020. The average household size fell from 2.9 to 2.2. The number of children declined by nearly 2,000 and the number of adults by 2,900.\nIn other words, about 4,800 fewer people live within immediate walking distance of the historic commercial corridors along Vliet Street, North Avenue, and (at the time) Lloyd Street. And these commercial districts have changed too. Along Vliet, Lloyd, and North, just between 47th Street and 60th, there were 12 food stores in 1960 (including corner stores & butchers) along with: 7 bakeries, 6 pharmacies, 10 taverns, 5 restaurants, 2 hardware stores, and dozens of other retail stores or service providers.6\nThe number of restaurants along Vliet and North has more than doubled since 1960, and the number of taverns has held mostly steady. But other kinds of retail have vanished. No bakeries and only two food retailers remain. There are no hardware stores and only one small pharmacy.\nNeighborhood grocery stores have been replaced by large supermarkets surrounded by parking lots across the country. In some measure, this reflects changing consumer preferences. But the decline in foot traffic along Milwaukee’s old neighborhood “downtowns” has also contributed to their diminished retail offerings. The commercial corridors in Milwaukee’s older neighborhoods were built without parking lots in an era when thousands more people lived within walking distance.\nThe story of Washington Heights is common across Milwaukee. As I’ve previously written, about 40% of the city is in “stable decline,” characterized by high occupancy rates but shrinking populations due to declining household sizes.\nConsider the portion of Bay View north of Oklahoma Avenue. These tracts have lost 5,600 residents since 1960. It would take nearly 3,500 more housing units to restore the population of 60 years ago, given current household sizes. That is despite the fact that Bay View has built more housing. The number of units has grown by more than 700 since 1960. Without that, the neighborhood’s population would have plummeted by perhaps another 1,200 residents.7\nSome neighborhoods have built enough new housing to stave off the post-1960 housing collapse, and their historic commercial districts reflect that.\nThe two census tracts on the east side between North Avenue and Park Place are good examples of this approach. Together, they have added 1,600 net new housing units since 1960. This has allowed the neighborhood’s overall population to remain steady despite the average household size falling.8\nSmall wonder then, that the neighborhood has sustained a genuinely comprehensive commercial district. The area around Downer Avenue includes a full grocery store, a bakery, hardware store, pharmacy, dry cleaner, and multiple medical providers.\nMuch of Milwaukee’s east side benefits from zoning rules that permit multi-family developments, whether apartment buildings or condos. Over 70% of the post-1960 construction in the two tracts near Downer Avenue occurred in parcels with high-density zoning classifications.\nOther neighborhoods, like Walker’s Point and parts of Bay View have successfully converted former industrial land and buildings into new housing. A current example is the redevelopment of the Filer and Stowell complex, which plans to build 576 new units across eight apartment buildings.\nDowntown Milwaukee has added a great deal of housing, often by converting old office buildings. An ongoing effort to redevelop the previously foreclosed 100 East building could create 350 apartments across its 35 stories.\nNone of these kinds of construction are an option for neighborhoods like Washington Heights. Unlike the east side, Washington Heights has no parcels zoned for high density development. Unlike Bay View or Downtown, Washington Heights was built as a purely residential neighborhood, so it doesn’t have legacy industrial sites or underused office buildings.\nWashington Heights has also seen few home demolitions, so it mostly lacks the large (or adjacent) empty lots necessary to build townhomes. In short, there are few existing options for restoring the historic population density to neighborhoods like this.\nThe city’s new draft zoning reform plan, Growing MKE, proposes a set of changes to make growing the housing supply in places like Washington Heights more possible.\nIf adopted, the plan would change the kinds of housing which can be built under the city’s various residential zoning classes. All residential zones would permit the construction of single-family homes, accessory dwelling units, townhomes, duplexes, triplexes, and cottage courts. Those areas already zoned for duplexes (a substantial portion of the city) would also allow 3 and 4-unit buildings. Another provision would make it easier to build apartment buildings on lots already zoned for them.\nLooking at the city as a whole, the most consequential aspects of Growing MKE are likely the provisions that encourage new multi-unit developments, from townhouses and cottage courts to quadplexes and small apartment buildings. These have the potential to grow the city’s housing stock the most.\nHowever, accessory dwelling units (ADUs) are the aspect of the Growing MKE plan most relevant to a neighborhood like Washington Heights. Most parcels in the neighborhood include a backyard with a garage that could be replaced with, or modified to include, a small house.\nThese kinds of small backlot houses are common in Milwaukee’s older neighborhoods, where they are often called “carriage houses.” Other houses with large basements could be converted to include an “internal ADU.”\nThere are about 2,000 houses in Washington Heights. Half of their owners have held them for 8 years or more. Given the rapid increase in home values, many residents have accumulated significant equity in their homes, which could be used to finance ADU construction.9\nADU construction tends to grow quickly in cities after the rules are changed to encourage them. Still, it’s not an overwhelming flood. In 2023, Seattle issued permits for 987 ADUs, up from 246 in 2018 (prior to reforms passed in 2019).\nThese numbers may seem low compared to the massive need for housing, but new construction is currently even more rare. Fewer than 150 single family homes or duplexes were built in Milwaukee in the last 4 years combined.10\nWhat would it take for Washington Heights to stop shrinking? At the current pace, households are shrinking by about 0.1 persons per decade. Put differently, every 10 years, each 10 houses lose 1 resident. There are about 2,900 households in Washington Heights. At that pace of change, the neighborhood will lose about 290 more residents by 2030. Avoiding that loss would require building around 140 more units.11\nThe zoning reforms proposed in the Growing MKE plan are intended to encourage property owners in the city to build more housing on their own. This will likely mainly happen in the parts of the city which are already relatively prosperous.\nFor the half of Milwaukee renters who spend more than 30% of their income on rent (and the quarter who spend 50% or more), market solutions alone are unlikely to build a sufficient quantity of actually affordable housing. But encouraging new housing construction in the parts of the city where the market will fund it is a crucial way for the city to create more options for property owners and renters alike, while also expanding its tax base.\nBy allowing the market to build housing in places where existing demand will pay for it, the city can better steer its resources toward subsidizing housing development in the neighborhoods of Milwaukee where the need is dire but the market will not provide it."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Voter turnout in Wisconsin this year was very high—among the highest ever in presidential elections in Wisconsin. Unofficial returns show 3,422,802 votes cast for president, up from 3,298,041 in 2020.1\nAbout 125,000 more people voted in 2024 than 2020. Meanwhile, the state’s over-18 population grew by an estimated 56,000 between 2020 and 2023.2\nWe won’t know the 2024 population estimate until sometime next month. If the over-18 population increase is fewer than 69,000, that will indicate that the share of adults voting in 2024 exceeded 2020, which was already an exceptional year.\nThe Wisconsin Elections Commission calculates that 72.9% of adults voted in 2020, which is the third highest rate since their data begins in 1948. In 1966, they estimate 72.0% voted and in 2004, 73.2%.3 Depending on the 2024 adult population estimate, the 2024 election will likely join this group of extremely high turnout elections where just shy of 3-in-4 adults participated.\nKeep in mind that turnout as a share of the voting eligible population is even higher. Here are some estimates from the [University of Florida Election Lab](https://election.lab.ufl.edu/.\nIn 2024, the Election Lab estimates that 76.4% of eligible voters in Wisconsin cast a ballot, compared to 63.5% nationally. In 2020 it was probably 75.0% in Wisconsin, compared to 66.4% nationally. Turnout in Wisconsin is usually higher than US average, but this year the gap grew especially large. In 2020, turnout was 8.6 points higher in Wisconsin, growing to 12.9 points higher in 2024.\nThe true voter turnout rate can only be estimated because the denominator (actually eligible citizens) is unknown. At least in a month or two, we’ll have more recent data for the state adult population, from which we can further refine these estimates of the eligible share.\nEstimates for the adult population of counties and municipalities will become available later in 2025. The kind of granular data needed to estimate ward-level adult population turnout rates won’t be available until the 2030 census.\nThe absence of high-quality data will not prevent the creation of turnout statistics, nor should they, necessarily. We cannot wait for the 2030 census to begin figuring out which voters were inspired by the last campaign and which weren’t. My point in elaborating these difficulties is to warn you that the first turnout statistics you see will not be the final word on the matter.\nHere is what the limited data we do have can tell us about voter turnout around Wisconsin.\nThe Census Bureau’s Population Estimate Program doesn’t provide adult population estimates for individual municipalities, so we’re stuck with total population estimates.\nIt is not the case that turnout fell in Democratic-leaning communities and increased in Republican ones. There is no correlation between a county’s change in turnout and the share of the vote received by Donald Trump. There may be a slight correlation between the increase in turnout and the increase in Trump’s share of the vote relative to 2020.\nHigh turnout helped Trump because a group of infrequent voters showed up and disproportionately supported him. These “low propensity” voters were spread evenly across the state, contributing to Wisconsin’s small but remarkably uniform 1.5-point swing toward Trump."

    "title": "The changing cost of buying vs renting",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Lubar Center’s latest research project takes a careful look at how housing affordability has changed in the Milwaukee metro in the early 2020s.\nOur article, “Can a typical worker still buy a house in the Milwaukee metro? Increasingly, no,” was published in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on October 9, 2024. Journal Sentinel business reporter Genevieve Redsten also contributed an article to the series, “Homeownership is less attainable in the Milwaukee area. Why new construction hasn’t been part of the solution.“\nOur research uncovered much more than could fit in a single story. We have shared additional resources in this web report. It includes more methodological details about our calculations and statistics for individual municipalities in the four-county Milwaukee area.\nPreviously, we’ve written about how the subprime mortgage crisis and the end of the residency requirement contributed to plummeting owner-occupancy rates in the City of Milwaukee. Home values fell to very low levels in Milwaukee, while rents remained relatively elevated. Consequently, home-ownership was far more cost effective than renting for many families. Meanwhile, rents–particularly in poor neighborhoods–were quite profitable. This profitable potential eventually brought Milwaukee (and similar rust belt cities) to the attention of private equity-backed corporate landlords in the late 2010s and early 2020s.\nThose same years saw owner occupancy finally begin to recover in Milwaukee. Owner-occupancy grew slightly in 2019, the first year-over-year increase since 2005. These circumstances combined to foster fierce competition between would-be homeowners and out-of-state investors, particularly in majority Black neighborhoods on the city’s north side.\n\n\n\nscatterplot showing the change in owner-occupied houses vs out-of-state landlord properties in aldermanic districts\n\n\nSince 2022, the market has cooled off. Home prices are still sky high, and increased interest rates have driven the monthly cost required to buy a house even higher. But high interest rates have also changed the calculus of corporate investors. All three of the large private equity backed firms operating in Milwaukee’s rental market have stopped buying and started selling in the past two years. For the first time since the subprime mortgage crisis began, the net number of homes owned by an out-of-state landlord actually declined in the City of Milwaukee during 2023, and that slight decline continued into the beginning of 2024 as well.\nNet levels of owner-occupancy continued to grow in 2023 and 2024, albeit at a much slower pace than the preceding several years. It’s no wonder why the market has cooled. Owner-occupancy is far less attainable for many workers, as our latest article discusses in detail. Also, the cost-benefit analysis of owning a home versus renting has shifted. In 2020, we calculated that a typical single family home was cheaper to own than rent, even when factoring in the same kinds of maintenance cost assumptions used by professional property managers. That is no longer true in 2024.\nHere is an even simpler comparison. This graph shows the average monthly rent in Milwaukee in blue and the monthly payment needed to buy the average house in red. Before 2018, the PITI (principal, interest, taxes, and insurance) needed to buy the average Milwaukee house was cheaper than the monthly rent for the average apartment (of any size). The two costs were about tied from 2018 through 2020. Since then, the relative cost of owning has skyrocketed, while rents have grown more modestly. “From 2019 to 2024, the monthly costs needed to buy an average home in the city of Milwaukee grew by $854 or an increase of 83%. The average monthly rent grew by $316, or 31%.”\n\n\n\nline graph comparing PITI with rent\n\n\nThese comparisons of monthly cost ignore the equity accrued by homeowners. This equity is substantial for homeowners who bought during the 2010s, and those owners also benefit from the low interest rates they either initially received or refinanced into. While increased home values exclude a growing number of workers from the home-buying market, they are a windfall for incumbent owners. We estimate that someone who bought the average house in Milwaukee in 2019, paying 5% down, has accrued an average of $78,000 in equity.\nMilwaukee remains more affordable than the great majority of major American cities, but home-buying has become far more difficult, even impossible, for many workers. And the financial benefit to buying a house instead of renting one is no longer as straightforward as during the late 2010s."

About 32% of Wisconsin adults (ages 25 and older) have earned a bachelor’s degree (or more).\nSince 2012, Democrats have gained the most in the parts of Milwaukee county where more than 50% have earned a bachelor’s degree.

    "title": "Homes in metro Milwaukee have long been considered affordable. Is that still true?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This article originally appeared in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\nFor a moment, imagine you’re a mail carrier. You’re early in your career and make just over $48,000 a year, or the median wage for all workers in the Milwaukee area. Could you buy a house in the city of Milwaukee on your salary alone?\nThe answer — which we’ll share later in this story — can help us better understand Milwaukee’s evolving housing picture.\nOwning a home has long been a part of the American dream, and for those looking to buy, especially first-timers, the state’s largest city offered access. Milwaukee featured dozens of neighborhoods where middle and working-class residents could afford to buy a house, often on a single income. But the city’s housing market changed dramatically in recent years. For many prospective homebuyers, what was possible only five years ago is no longer realistic today.\nIn our latest Milwaukee Area Project examining life in the metro, we sought to answer the question: Is housing in the city (and its suburbs) still affordable? We focused on the period from 2019 to 2024 — from before the pandemic upended existing economic trends to where the housing market is today.\nSome of what we discovered wasn’t surprising. Buying a house is more expensive today, relative to income, than at any point in the last two decades. This is true in Milwaukee and the nation. The increase in housing costs in the last five years outpaced wage gains. That resulted in a growing number of workers in the metro area being priced out of the market.\nIt’s also true that the city of Milwaukee remains a relative “bargain” compared to other major cities — not just Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York, but Minneapolis, Chicago and even Madison.\nBuying a house in the city of Milwaukee is significantly more affordable than the national average. This has been the case for decades and it’s still true today. For most of the last 25 years, the metro’s median salary was enough on its own to purchase the typical house in the city. Buying a house was even easier for households with two wage earners.\nStill, costs here have risen enough to challenge the value proposition of owning a home. Our research found that even among single-family homes in the city of Milwaukee, it is now generally cheaper to rent than to buy.\nWhen we talk about what is affordable, we use the definition the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development uses. Standard financial advice is that a household should spend no more than 30% of its gross (pre-tax) income on housing expenses. Some are comfortable with spending more, but the 30% guideline is a good measure of affordability.\nEscalating costs, even in comparatively affordable Milwaukee, are making homeownership more difficult. A typical less expensive (25th percentile) house in the city cost about $71,000 in 2019. Today it costs $126,000, a 77% increase. An average home cost $126,000 in 2019. Today, it goes for $206,000. And a more expensive (75th percentile) home in the city went for just shy of $200,000 in 2019. Today, that home sells for $294,000.\nFurther, while we hear a lot about homes selling for cash offers, that’s not the way most prospective homebuyers will buy a house. They’ll need a mortgage. So, the number that really matters is not the home’s sticker price, but the monthly payment they can afford. That payment includes principal, interest, taxes, and insurance.\nThose monthly payments increased far faster than home values because of rapidly rising interest rates and increasing home insurance rates. To get a better sense of what’s happened, we assumed common characteristics for a first-time homebuyer, including 5% down and 1% private mortgage insurance. We found that the monthly cost to buy the average home in the city jumped from $1,023 in 2019 to $1,877 in 2024.\nIn 2019, the monthly payment needed to buy the average city of Milwaukee house worked out to 30% of the median full-time salary in the metro. That jumped to 45% in 2024 (based on preliminary salary estimates).\nWhile two wage earners in a home can help with the affordability issue, it’s worth noting that our previous research found that single-person households now make up more than one-third of the households in the city.\nEven in 2019, the city of Milwaukee was the only municipality in the county where a single average wage earner could afford the average house by themselves. That affordability is due in part to a larger supply of smaller homes. It also reflects concerns about crime and struggling schools, which depress prices in some neighborhoods.\nBut in Milwaukee County, at least, a couple — each earning the average salary — could still afford the average home in most suburbs. That, too, is more challenging today.\nThe ranks of affordable suburbs shrank considerably in the last five years. By 2023, only seven of 19 Milwaukee County municipalities were affordable for a family with two median wage earners (a total of $97,000).\nHere’s another way to look at this trend. We identified professions with incomes closest to the affordability threshold, where monthly house payments equal 30% of the average wage.\nIn 2019, a typical first-line factory supervisor making $63,000 could afford the average house in Greenfield. In 2023, it took a salary of $100,000 to afford that same house, typical of what electrical engineers earn.\nIn 2019, a typical tool and die maker with a median salary of $52,000 could afford the average house in West Allis. In 2023, it took a salary of $83,000 to afford that house, typical of what a registered nurse earned.\nOther occupations saw homeownership slip out of reach entirely.\nWe also looked at the cost of houses in Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington counties. Buying a home in the WOW counties is considerably more expensive than the national average. In Waukesha, the price of the average house grew from $324,000 in 2019 to $455,000 in 2024. In Ozaukee, it jumped from $335,000 to $452,000. In Washington, historically the most affordable of the three counties, the average home went for $277,000 to $392,000.\nA key factor in why housing affordability remains elusive for so many is wage growth in the metro area. Wages rose in the last five years, but not nearly as quickly as home prices.\nData from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that in 2001 workers in metro Milwaukee earned a bit more than workers nationally. This was true across the board, for those making a little and those making a lot. For example, an average paid worker in metro Milwaukee made about $1,330 more a year than the national average.\nBut by 2023, higher earners in metro Milwaukee had fallen behind the national average. One noteworthy example: the highest paid workers in metro Milwaukee took home $610 more than the national average in 2001. In 2023, they made $16,330 less.\nWorkers in the bottom half of the income ladder overall still were above the national average, but their advantage had shrunk. And the lowest paid workers had fallen behind. In 2001, they made $1,170 more than the national average. In 2023, they made $720 less.\nThe sharp increase in housing prices and the jump in monthly costs for ownership could lead some to reconsider the benefits of owning a home. That’s a significant change. As late as 2020, we found that owning a home usually resulted in lower monthly costs than renting a single family house, even when including maintenance costs.\nToday, it’s a different story. That’s because, even among single family homes, the monthly costs associated with ownership have increased so much faster than the cost of rent.\nResearchers know considerably less about the rental market than home values. The results of every property sale are publicly available, but there is no central repository for information about rents. So, we turned to the private company Zillow, whose data and methodology offer the best insights into the local rental market.\nFrom 2019 to 2024, the monthly costs needed to buy an average home in the city of Milwaukee grew by $854 or an increase of 83%. The average monthly rent grew by $316, or 31%. Put another way, the monthly payments associated with homeownership — nearly $1,900 — were $550 more than the typical rent.\nThat was true elsewhere in the metro. Typical rents in Milwaukee and Waukesha counties, for example, grew about 30%. For those workers most likely to be renting (those in the bottom half of the income ladder) wages grew faster than inflation in the early 2020s, closely tracking the growth in rents while trailing skyrocketing ownership costs.\nDespite claims that rents here have risen unusually quickly, the data suggests otherwise. Among the nation’s 100 largest metro areas, rent increases in metro Milwaukee ranked higher than most in the last year. But from 2019 to 2024, our percentage growth in rents was slower than in all but 25 of the nation’s 100 largest metros. Metro Milwaukee had the 21st cheapest rents in 2019, among the largest 100. In 2024, it was the 13th cheapest.\nStill, that comes as little consolation to those on fixed incomes in the metro, a surprisingly large number. Our research found that more than a quarter of renter households in the metro Milwaukee area include no employed people. Most are likely retirees while others are students or live on public assistance. Affording rent has likely become much more difficult for them.\nFor some, the last five years have been an enormous source of frustration. Their hopes of buying a house became increasingly bleak. In the city of Milwaukee, prospective working-class homebuyers often found themselves shut out of the market as prices for inexpensive and average houses rose sharply, interest rates spiked, and out-of-state investors went on a buying spree. In 2019, nearly a quarter of the city’s houses cost $71,000 or less. Today, that market has largely disappeared.\nTo put it in more personal terms, let’s return to our example of the early career mail carrier. With careful budgeting, that postal worker could have afforded the average house in Milwaukee in 2019. Today, that is no longer the case.\nWhat also makes the last five years frustrating for some is that they missed an opportunity to save money and build wealth. In 2019, the monthly cost needed to buy the average house was about $850 lower than in 2024. Property records show that more than 3,100 present-day homeowners bought their house in 2019. By staying current on their payments, we estimate that they have built, on average, $78,000 in equity.\nIn several years of writing about housing in the Milwaukee area, we have been struck by how quickly the market can change. With a new push for more housing and the prospect of lower interest rates, it may pivot yet again in the coming years. Owning a house may continue to be part of the American dream.\nBut for now, in metro Milwaukee, that dream is harder to realize.\nData Note: We used several data sources in this analysis. Home value data is from the smoothed, seasonally adjusted version of the Zillow Home Value Index. Rent data is from the smoothed, seasonally adjusted Zillow Observed Rent Index. Wage data is from Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics program. The BLS calculates annual full-time wages by multiplying hourly rates by 2,080. All annual estimates are as of May of each year. We estimate monthly PITI payments using mortgage rates provided by Freddie Mac, gross municipal tax rates from the Wisconsin Department of Revenue and the Wisconsin Policy Forum, and insurance premiums from Census Bureau.\nFor complete methodological details and additional analysis, see the Marquette Law School Faculty Blog post with the same date as this article."

    "section": "",
    "text": "During my years in Milwaukee, I’ve lived in 4 different neighborhoods. The walking distances to my wards’ polling places have been as follows: 0.2 miles, 0.2 miles, 0.3 miles, and roughly 400 ft. Walking has always been the simplest way to cast my ballot.\nThis is true for many Milwaukeeans. Compared to most parts of America, including most major cities, Milwaukee excels at making the polls convenient to access.\nOver 56% of houses are within half a mile, or a 10 minute walk, of their designated election day polling place. And I’m not counting distance as the crow flies. This is the distance it takes to walk on streets and paths accessible to pedestrians.\nSpecifically, I calculate that 12.4% of Milwaukee houses are located fewer than 5 minutes from their polling place by foot. Another 44.1% are within a 5-10 minute walk; 27.4% are a 10-15 minute walk away; and just 16.1% are further.\nFor these calculations, I assume that it takes 1 minute to walk 80 meters, or 262 feet. This works out to 5 minutes per quarter mile, a common standard for walkability.\nFor instance, here are Milwaukee wards 240 and 285, both of which vote at the Humboldt Park Pavilion in the Bay View neighborhood. Together, these two wards have about 2,300 registered voters living in 1,600 housing units.\nHere is another polling place, the Clinton Rose Senior Center, near the intersection of King Drive and Burleigh St. This location also serves about 1,600 homes, but more of them are apartments. In fact, 12% of the housing units are within a 5 minute walk, 71% are within 5-10 minutes, and the remaining 17% are 10-15 minutes away.\nClick here to open an interactive map with statistics for each ward in the city. From the interactive map, you can click the ward name in each tooltip to open a png file with each polling place, as mapped above.\nAs you might expect, polling places are closest together in the most densely populated sections of the city. Many of the areas which appear poorly covered on the map are not actually populated—this includes the industrial Menomonee Valley, the port, the airport, and many large parks and cemeteries.\nExceptions include the far north and northwest sides, where few residents live within convenient walking distance of their polling place. Here the normal street grid breaks down, and many people live in subdivisions with poor pedestrian connectivity. The population is also less dense, so individual wards are larger.\nThe citywide map also reveals some wards which are physically much closer to a different polling place than their own. In these cases, it might be possible to better optimize ward-to-polling place assignments.\nOverall, access to polling places is fairly even across the city’s racial or ethnic groups. Using 2020 census data, I estimate that 52% of Black, 57% of white, 63% of Hispanic, and 52% of Asian residents live within a 10 minute walk of their polling place. Conversely, those living 15 minutes away or further includes 18% of Black, 16% of white, 11% of Hispanic, and 22% of Asian residents.\nProximity is highest for Latino Milwaukeeans because their numbers are highest in the densely populated near south side. In contrast, much of Milwaukee’s Asian population lives in the less dense far north and northwest sides of the city.\nPopulation by walking time to polling place\n\n\nCity of Milwaukee\n\n\n\ntotal\nBlack\nWhite\nHispanic or Latino\nAsian\n\n\n\n\n0-5 min.\n12%\n11%\n12%\n15%\n11%\n\n\n5-10 min.\n44%\n41%\n45%\n48%\n41%\n\n\n10-15 min.\n28%\n29%\n27%\n26%\n27%\n\n\n15+ min.\n16%\n18%\n16%\n11%\n22%\n\n\n\nDemographic data is from the 2020 census and is assigned into isochrone areas using a housing-unit crosswalk.\nMy methodology is too detailed to easily replicate across the United States, but fortunately the federal government collects information about polling places after each election through the biennial Election Administration and Voting Survey. I downloaded the 2022 data and compared the number of registered voters with the number of polling places in each jurisdiction.\nAmong the largest 500 jurisdictions in the country, Milwaukee ranked 51st for the most polling places per registered voters. There was one polling place for every 1,661 registered voters in 2022. The median, across the largest 500 jurisdictions, was one polling place for every 3,073 voters.\nThere is a lot of variation in this metric. Cities in Pennsylvania score especially well, holding 9 out of the top 10 spots. Philadelphia County had 630 voters per polling place, Allegheny County 710.\nIn contrast, most California cities have few polling places for their size. Los Angeles County had just 640 election day polling places in 2022, one for every 11,581 registered voters. For San Diego County it was one for 11,002 voters, for Orange county 11,267.\nMilwaukee also provides proportionally more polling places than other cities in Wisconsin. By necessity, small towns often have higher rates of polling places per capita. But Milwaukee has a higher rate of polling places than all of the other 30 largest cities in the state. The largest community with more per capita than Milwaukee is Stevens Point (pop. 26,000).\nElection administration is an increasingly difficult job, subject to conspiracy theories and threats of violence. It’s worth remembering and appreciating that, in Milwaukee, voting is still made admirably easy. For most Milwaukeeans, their polling place (and the opportunity to register) is just a short walk out their front door on November 5th."

An advantage to using OSM data (in addition to its being free) is that it includes informal paths, not just strictly official walkways as Google Maps generally does.\nI used Jeremy Gelb’s excellent spNetwork R package to calculate isochrones around each polling place. The original isochrone just consists of lines, so I converted each isochrone to polygons using a minimum concave hull algorithm implemented in the concaveman R package. Finally, I subsetted each of these isochrone polygon sets to just the ward boundaries served by each polling place.\nI combined all these individual polling place polygon isochrones, intersected them with the centroid coordinates for each parcel in the city, and aggregated the number of residential units in each."

    "text": "Measuring two kinds of incumbency advantage\nThe 2024 election is the first to use maps drawn by Democratic Governor Tony Evers, rather than previous maps drawn by Republican legislators. When the new state assembly maps were first released, I estimated that the 2022 assembly elections would’ve resulted in 46 Democratic seats, had the election taken place under the new maps. This, despite the fact that Governor Evers won reelection in that year by 3 percentage points.\nIncumbency advantage comes from at least two sources. In places where they’ve run before, incumbents likely enjoy higher name recognition than an opponent. Apart from that, they might still run better campaigns simply by dint of greater experience.\nRedistricting offers a unique opportunity to decompose these two sources of incumbent strength. Most incumbents ran in new districts which only partially overlapped with their previous seat. The benefits of name recognition should primarily exist just in those overlapping areas, while the benefits of experience should appear everywhere.\nTo measure this, I created a statistical model predicting the assembly vote in each ward based on the following variables:\n    Vote for President\n    Vote for US Senator\n    Dummy variables for:\n        If the Republican candidate previously represented this ward\n        If the Republican candidate previously represented other wards\n        If the Democratic candidate previously represented this ward\n        If the Democratic candidate previously represented other wards\nI dropped the small number of wards which were split between previous districts from the analysis. As you might expect, the terms for the two statewide races explain almost all the variation in vote between individual wards. But the coefficients for incumbency status are all strongly significant as well. Here are those results.\nImagine a hypothetical 50/50 ward in an assembly district perfectly divided between the parties. If either the Democratic or Republican candidate were an incumbent who had not previously represented this district, we would expect them to win by a bit more than a point. The coefficient for Republican incumbents is slightly higher than for Democrats, but the difference is not statistically significant.\n\n\n\nGraph showing the size of incumbency advantage coefficients\n\n\nNow consider another hypothetical 50/50 ward which was previously represented by the same incumbent running for reelection. The model predicts an advantage to a Democratic incumbent of about 2.5 points, while for a Republican it is about 4.25 points.\nIn other words, Democratic and Republican assembly candidates appeared to benefit equally from incumbency when running in wards new to their districts, but Republicans benefited more from name recognition than Democratic incumbents.\nWhy is this? I don’t know. In 2022, there was no difference in incumbency advantage between Democrats and Republicans.\nHere are the full results of the model. All values are expressed as margin points, or the Democratic percent of the two-party vote minus the Republican percent. The intercept of the model is a ward with no assembly incumbent and a tie in both in presidential and US senate races.\nIn this scenario, the model predicts a 3.1-point victory for the Republican assembly candidate. Holding every other variable constant, a 1-point increase in support for Harris predicts a 0.4-point increase in support for the assembly Democratic, and a 1-point increase support for Baldwin predicts a 0.6-point increase in support for the local Democrat.\nIn plain English, the model shows that Republican assembly candidates did about 3 points better than Trump or Hovde, even when they weren’t incumbents. Incumbents running in new wards improved on this by a bit more than 1 point, whether Democratic or Republican. When incumbents ran in wards they had previously represented, Republicans did about 4.3 points better than otherwise expected, compared to just 2.5 points better for Democrats.\nThe vote for president and US senate are both extremely correlated with the vote for state assembly. That said, the vote for US senate is a bit more predictive.\n\n\n\nTable summarizing the incumbency advantage model"

    "text": "Where incumbency made the biggest difference\nIf no incumbents had run, my model suggests that several races might have ended differently. Incumbency advantage probably saved two or three Republicans and one Democrat. So, in its absence, Democrats likely would’ve netted one or two extra Assembly seats, still less than a majority.\nThe seats where incumbency likely made the biggest difference are as follows:\n\nThe 21st, in the southern Milwaukee County suburbs, where incumbent Republican Jessie Rodriguez narrowly defeated a Democratic challenger. Rodriguez was first elected in 2013.\nThe 61st, in the southwestern Milwaukee County suburbs, where incumbent Republican Bob Donovan defeated LuAnn Bird in a rematch of his first election in 2022. Prior to serving in the Assembly, Donovan was a longtime alderman on Milwaukee’s near south side. In would not surprise me if many of his suburban constituents, like Donovan himself, also previously lived on Milwaukee’s south side.\nThe 51st, west of Madison in southwestern Wisconsin, where moderate Republican Todd Novak won reelection to a sixth term.\nThe 94th, stretching from La Crosse north along the Mississippi River, where Steve Doyle won a seventh term. This continued Doyle’s streak of winning close races in one of Wisconsin’s most competitive districts.\n\nThe next graph shows how well each candidate performed compared with the model’s expectations, taking into account incumbency status in each ward and the vote for president and senate.\nThe two seats shown in blue are seats that Democrats won despite the model predicting a Republican victory. They are the previously discussed Steve Doyle seat and the 26th district, covering the city of Sheboygan. Here, the Democrat Joe Sheehan narrowly incumbent Republican Amy Binsfield, who represented the partially overlapping 27th district. Sheehan outperformed the model’s expectations more than any other Democrat.\nRepublicans won the two red seats, contrary to the model’s expectations. These are Todd Novak in the previously mentioned 51st district and Dean Kaufert in the 53rd (Neenah/Menasha).\n\n\n\nScatterplot comparing actual vs predicted margins in assembly races\n\n\nThe Republican politicians who most outperformed the model’s expectations are found in the deep red 41st, 49th, 69th, and 70th districts."

    "text": "Republican assembly candidates were more popular than Trump or Hovde\nIn 2024, Republican incumbency advantage came in two forms for assembly candidates. For one, there were just a lot more Republican incumbents running in contested races than Democrats. But Republican incumbents were also more popular than Democratic incumbents when running in wards they had previously represented. This fact is different than in 2022, and I don’t have a good explanation for it. Possibly Republican politicians did a better job than Democrats at building name recognition among the less-frequent voters who show up in presidential years.\nStill, even combining the two sources of incumbency advantage only explains one or two of the 4 and 5 seats, respectively, that Trump and Hovde lost but assembly Republicans won.\nAbout 27% of the state’s voters lived in a ward with a contested, open assembly race—where no incumbent ran. These wards were slightly more Democratic than the state as a whole. Harris won them by 1.2 points and Baldwin by 3.4. But across all these wards, the Republican candidates eked out a 0.7-point victory.\nMany observers of the 2024 election have concluded that Trump was a strong candidate and Harris a weak one. That story is not entirely consistent with the evidence from Wisconsin. To an extent not explained by incumbency effects, Trump was less popular than the average Republican assembly candidate, and Harris performed better than most Democrats running for state office."

But to shed more light into what Americans really think about him, the Marquette Law School Poll has begun asking two open-ended questions. What do you [like/dislike] about Donald Trump?

He enjoyed especially high support among those who hadn’t voted at all in 2020.\nMost of these people still approve of how Trump has begun his second term. However, Trump’s approval rating has slipped with this group, relative to December 2024.\nIn December 2024, 53% of adults approved (and 47% disapproved) of how Trump had handled his job during his first term. About a month into Trump’s second term, 48% approve and 52% disapprove of how Trump is currently handling his job.\nThe drop in approval is entirely due to lower views of Trump’s current job performance among those with more ambivalent views of him.\nAmong those who only listed things they like about Trump, 96% approved of his past job performance in the December poll and 96% likewise approve of his current job performance in the February poll.\nConversely, 97% of those with only negative things to say about Trump disapproved of his past job performance in December and disapprove of his current job performance in February.\nBut among those with mixed views of Trump, 77% gave him retrospective approval in December, falling to 67% approval in February."

    "text": "Themes in the open-ended responses\nSome voters express idiosyncratic combinations of views when given the opportunity. You’ll find the occasional conservative whose only complaint about Trump is his support for Israel or the odd Harris voter who dislikes Trump’s “racist attitude” but appreciates that he “doesn’t drink or smoke dope.”\nBut most responses fall into familiar categories. Here are a few themes that stood out to me.\n\nOutside of the 36% of adults who despise Trump, Trump’s hyper-aggressive first month in office is usually perceived favorably. Many people said things like, “he’s fulfilling campaign promises,” or “He has already done more in a few days than Biden did.”\nA common complaint among those who generally like Trump is his communication style. Some representative comments: “he talks too much”; “the way he talks, very crude”; and “mean tweets, rehearsing [sic] his wins in election too often.”\nOn the other hand, even some people who disapprove of him like aspects of his communication. “Confidence, has charisma, is funny on occasion”; “He’s funny. He says what he thinks.”\nQuite a few people complained about Trump’s pardoning of the January 6th rioters, and few or none mentioned it favorably.\n\nFinally, these data also undermine a point I have occasionally heard from conservative commentators. Referencing the more “muted” response to Trump’s second term from Democratic politicians and left-leaning organizations, some have argued that opposition toward Trump’s first term was largely an elite, media creation.\nOn the contrary, in reading these open-ended responses I see no diminution of opposition to Trump. If anything, the vitriolic tone may have intensified among those who like nothing about him. This group is not a majority of the country. It includes under 40% of adults in our sample, but is is more than twice as large as the group of people with only positive things to say about Trump.\nDuring Trump’s first term, his opponents turned out at unusually high levels–flipping seats during special elections and midterms at a startling clip. Democrats will look to repeat that playbook in 2025 and 2026. The surprise victory of a Democratic candidate in a Trump +21 Iowa state senate district is a small, early indication that this strategy may work."

    "text": "Degree of Change\nSince the legislature and governor failed to reach an agreement on redistricting, the process has moved to the Wisconsin Supreme Court. In December, the Court’s conservative majority decided to adopt a “least change” approach to the existing districts. Since these districts were created by a strong Republican gerrymander in 2011, any districts created by this process will be a victory for the GOP.\nThat said, some variation is still possible within the framework of “least change.” Six different entities submitted plans to the Court, which may choose one of them or draw their own. The planners are:\n\nGovernor Evers\nthe Republican-controlled legislature\nthe Milwaukee-based advocacy group Black Leaders Organizing Communities (BLOC),\nState Senator Bewley (representing Senate Democrats)\na Democratic-aligned activist named Lisa Hunter\na group of intervenors going by the name Citizen Mathemeticians and Scientists (MathSci) who use computational redistricting techniques.\n\nNeither Bewley nor BLOC submitted a Congressional redistricting plan. Incidentally, the Bewley plans for Assembly and Senate are the only maps submitted which use the wards recently drawn by local governments as their building blocks. All the other plans use 2020 census blocks.\n\nPopulation preserved\nThe simplest measure of “least change” is just the share of the population moved from one district to another in a given redistricting plan. By this measure, Evers’ plan makes the fewest changes–moving just 14.2% of Wisconsin’s population into an Assembly district with a new district number.\nThe Legislature’s plan moves slightly more Wisconsinites into a new Assembly seat (15.8%). BLOC and Bewley move incrementally more, 15.9% and 16.4%, respectively.\nThe Hunter and MathSci plans appear to have given little effort to “least change” considerations. The Hunter plan moves 26.9% of the state into a new Assembly district, while the MathSci plan moves 39%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortion of population placed in the same district\n\n\nin proposed redistricting plans\n\n\n\nassembly\nsenate\ncongress\n\n\n\n\nevers\n14.2%\n7.8%\n5.5%\n\n\nlegis\n15.8%\n7.8%\n6.5%\n\n\nbloc2\n15.9%\n10.4%\n\n\n\n\nbewley\n16.4%\n9.5%\n\n\n\n\nhunter\n26.9%\n19.2%\n7.0%\n\n\nmathsci\n39.0%\n25.7%\n8.5%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistrict overlap\nDistrict numbers are not necessarily meaningful. A planner could closely preserve the boundaries of existing districts while also changing the numbering scheme entirely. But in practice, none of the planners did this in their final submissions.\nFor each submitted plan, I calculated the overlap between new an old districts. In the Legislature’s Assembly plan, 98 of the new districts primarily overlap with the old district using the same number. Ninety-seven of the districts in Evers’ and BLOC’s plans do so, as do 96 of Bewley’s, 90 of Hunter’s, and 80 of MathSci’s. Only the MathSci plan contains a senate district which doesn’t mainly overlap with the same old senate district. All the proposed new Congressional districts mainly overlap with the same old Congressional district number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of districts mainly overlapping with the same old district\n\n\nin proposed redistricting plans\n\n\n\nassembly\nsenate\ncongress\n\n\n\n\nmathsci\n80\n32\n8\n\n\nhunter\n90\n33\n8\n\n\nbewley\n96\n33\n\n\n\n\nbloc2\n97\n33\n\n\n\n\nevers\n97\n33\n8\n\n\nlegis\n98\n33\n8"

Strict population equality is the standard for congressional districts. The Supreme Court lets state legislative districts vary by as much as 10%.

    "text": "Minority Districts\nNone of the plans vary in their creation of Hispanic majority or influence districts, but they do vary somewhat in the number of Black districts they create. In the figures below, I calculate these figures as the Black and Hispanic shares of the voting age population, and I define Black as those choosing “Black or African American alone” in the 2020 census. Alternatively, one could count the number of adults choosing Black either alone or in combination with another race. That method of counting would reveal the same pattern with slightly higher numbers.\nI define “majority” as more than 50% and “strong” as 40% - 50%.\nGiven Wisconsin’s geography, planners typically choose to draw either 6 or 7 Assembly districts where at least 40% of the voting age population is Black. Focusing on drawing districts with outright Black majorities limits the total to 6.\nFor example, the plans drawn by Bewley and the Legislature both include 4 districts with an outright Black majority and 2 which are at least 40% Black. By contrast, the plans drawn by Evers and BLOC both draw zero districts with a Black majority, but they succeed in drawing 7 districts where more than 45% of the adult population is Black.\nThe Hunter plan succeeds in drawing 2 majority-Black districts and 5 strong Black districts. But it attains this goal by drawing 2 districts where the Black population is in the low 40s.\nThe MathSci plan is a clear outlier. It would create three majority Black districts, including one where Black residents constitute more than 80% of the adult population. But it creates no 40%-50% Black districts. Instead, there are 4 districts where between 30% and 40% of the population is Black.\n\ntableAssembly chartSenate chart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVRA Assembly districts under Wisconsin redistricting plans\n\n\n\nblack1\nhispanic2\n\n\nmajority3\nstrong4\nmajority3\nstrong4\n\n\n\n\nassembly\n\n\nbewley\n4\n2\n2\n0\n\n\nbloc2\n0\n7\n2\n0\n\n\nevers\n0\n7\n2\n0\n\n\nhunter\n2\n5\n2\n0\n\n\nlegis\n4\n2\n2\n0\n\n\nmathsci\n3\n0\n2\n0\n\n\nsenate\n\n\nbewley\n2\n0\n0\n1\n\n\nbloc2\n0\n2\n0\n1\n\n\nevers\n0\n2\n0\n1\n\n\nhunter\n1\n1\n0\n1\n\n\nlegis\n2\n0\n0\n1\n\n\nmathsci\n1\n1\n0\n1\n\n\n\n1 Includes non-Hispanic Black alone adults\n\n\n2 Includes Hispanic or Latino adults of any race\n\n\n3 more than 50%\n\n\n4 between 40% and 50%"

    "text": "Partisan lean\nI like to describe a plan’s partisan implications using two statistics. How many seats would Democrats likely win in a statewide tie, and how large of a statewide victory do Democrats require to have a realistic chance of winning a legislative majority?\nPlans vary considerably by both statistics. In a statewide tie, BLOC’s plan is best for Democrats. They would expect to win 42 Assembly seats. The MathSci, Hunter, and Bewley plans would probably yield 39 Democratic seats in a statewide tie. The Evers plan would make 38, and the Legislature’s plan 36.\nBewley’s plan makes it easiest for Democrats to win a statewide majority. A statewide victory of 6.2 (53.1%) points would put 50 seats in play. BLOC’s plan is about the same, requiring a 6.6 point swing, followed by Evers plan (7.4), Hunter’s (7.6), and MathSci (10.4).\nUnsurprisingly, the plan passed by legislative Republicans is clearly the worse for Democrats. Under that map, Democrats would need to win Wisconsin by 12.4 points, or 56.2% of the two-party vote, in order to have a decent chance at winning 50 Assembly seats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic performance under proposed redistricting plans\n\n\nBased on a uniform statewide swing from the current partisan baseline\n\n\n\nseats won in a statewide tie\nstatewide margin needed for a majority\nseats won in a statewide tie\nstatewide margin needed for a majority\nseats won in a statewide tie\nstatewide margin needed for a majority\n\n\nassembly\nassembly\nsenate\nsenate\ncongress\ncongress\n\n\n\n\nlegis\n36\n12.4\n10\n10.6\n2\n15.5\n\n\nevers2\n38\n7.4\n11\n8.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbewley\n39\n6.2\n12\n6.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhunter\n39\n7.6\n11\n9.3\n2\n15.4\n\n\nmathsci\n39\n10.4\n11\n6.4\n3\n16.1\n\n\nbloc2\n42\n6.6\n11\n8.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nevers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n16.1\n\n\n\nPartisan baselines are calculated as the average of the 2016 pres, 2018 gov, and 2020 pres elections in each district.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly chartSenate chartCongress chart"

The bridges across the Milwaukee River are often angled to accomodate the different street layouts on either side. One of these early difficulties featured in the 1845 Bridge War between Juneautown and Kilbourntown.\n\nThe long diagonal streets follow old farm-to-market routes, often developed as plank toll roads, or “turnpikes.” They are often named for their destination, “such as Watertown Plank, Mukwonago, and Green Bay Roads, and Lisbon, Appleton, and Fond du Lac Avenues.”\n\nThe rectangular street grid pretty much disappears in Greendale, reflecting its origin as an experimental New Deal greenbelt planned community.\n\n\n\nmap showing Milwaukee streets which deviate from the grid"

    "section": "Implications for the 2022 election",
    "text": "Implications for the 2022 election\nIt’s easy to see the past in the current special election to replace Tom Barrett. Bob Donovan is running again, so is Lena Taylor. As in 2004, a Black acting mayor is trying to win the office in his own right.\nBut there are important differences between Milwaukee’s electorate in 2004 and today. In 2004, a majority of the city’s adults were probably still non-Hispanic white.6 Now, about 39% are. Thirty-five percent of Milwaukee adults are Black, 18% are Hispanic or Latino, and 5% are Asian. A successful mayoral candidate in 2021 must have a coalition that is, at least to some degree, multiracial.\nThe composition of that coalition may be surprising. Consider the 2020 county executive race–the most recent high profile local election for an open seat in Milwaukee. The officially nonpartisan race pitted two well-known Democratic state legislators against each other. David Crowley, a Black State Assemblyman representing part of the north side, ran against Chris Larson, a white State Senator representing most of the East Side. Larson is an avowed liberal, while Crowley carved out a somewhat more moderate position.\nAlthough this election followed the familiar pattern of the Black candidate winning the north side and the white candidate winning nearly everywhere else, this time the Black candidate won a majority. In addition to winning countywide, Crowley carried the City of Milwaukee with 52% of the vote to Larson’s 48%.\nIn a tightly-contested race like this, small vote shifts matter a lot. Crowley’s dominant vote share (74%) in majority Black wards was insufficient to win the city overall. Crowley won because he was better than Larson at getting votes outside of his geographic base. Larson won 25% of the vote in majority Black wards. Crowley won 39% of the vote in majority white wards. In fact, Crowley did somewhat better in more conservative white parts of the city compared to more liberal ones. Among majority white wards, Crowley took more of the vote in places that Donovan won in 2016’s primary than in wards Barrett won.\nThis pattern also extended to the suburbs. For instance, Larson handily won the liberal suburb of Shorewood, while Crowley narrowly defeated him in Franklin, Milwaukee County’s most conservative suburb.\n\nTom Barrett won his first term as mayor by consolidating the white vote and defeating near unanimous support for Marvin Pratt in the city’s majority Black wards. In subsequent elections, Barrett vastly expanded his appeal. His landslide victories in 2008 and 2012 were only slightly correlated with race, and he clearly won majority support from every group. In more contentious elections, Barrett received support and opposition alternately from the parts of the city outside his base along the lakeshore.\nGiven Milwaukee’s more diverse population, I do not think a candidate with Barrett’s 2004 coalition could win the mayor’s office. The next mayor will necessarily come to power via a more diverse set of supporters. But the nature of that coalition is unclear. David Crowley set one example, combining a strong performance on the north side with a significant minority of white voters, particularly from the far south and southwest sides.\nOther coalitions could also be victorious. I’ve scarcely mentioned the Latino community in this analysis. Latinos now make up a fifth of the city’s population and 15% of its adults, but they have lower rates of both citizenship and electoral participation. The political diversity of Latino voters also should not be underestimated. To the extent that Milwaukee Latinos can be described as a singular political constituency, I think their full electoral influence has yet to be felt.\nMilwaukee voters have a long tradition of keeping incumbents around. Barrett’s enduring personal popularity helped him gain the backing of markedly different political coalitions. While he was the consistent first choice of a minority of voters, he was more acceptable than the alternative to nearly every voter in the city at one time or another.\nIt has been 18 years since Milwaukee last chose a new mayor. Some new voters will have spent their entire life with Mayor Barrett. Without that familiar name on the ballot, Milwaukee’s next mayor has the opportunity to forge an entirely new political coalition."

It’s a contest that pits working class residents against wealthy out-of-state investment firms in a race for the city’s most affordable houses. The Milwaukeeans’ dream of becoming homeowners, of putting down roots in their community. The investors also dream of buying homes in Milwaukee but for very different reasons. They are distant landlords, often with little or no connection to the city. They see Milwaukee as a lucrative rental market, a place to make money.\nWe first began writing about changes to Milwaukee’s housing market several years ago. In January of 2020, we noted a troubling trend in the city. From 2005 to 2018, owner-occupancy of homes fell sharply, from a modern day high of 80% to 68%.\nSince then, Milwaukee has weathered a deadly pandemic and witnessed homicides and opioid deaths soar to record levels.\nBut beneath those disheartening headlines was some encouraging news. In the last few years, more local residents bought homes in the city. Not to rent to someone else, but to live in. A vote of confidence in Milwaukee’s future."

    "text": "After a decade, a rebound in owner-occupancy\nNew research by Marquette Law School’s Lubar Center for Public Policy Research and Civic Education shows the city began rebounding from a dramatic decade-long decline in owner-occupancy.\nThe number of people living in the homes they own has been rising since 2018. There are 3,000 more owner-occupied houses in Milwaukee now than at the end of 2018. That includes single family houses, condominiums, duplexes, and triplexes. This wave of purchasing has caused owner-occupancy rates in the city to climb from 68% to 70%. A small increase, but significant, nonetheless.\n“The trend, if it continues, is good news for city neighborhoods and for individuals who are looking to be owner occupants,” Mayor Cavalier Johnson said.\n“There are tens of thousands of people who would like to become homeowners in the city. And with these new numbers, it looks as if local homeowners are incrementally regaining ground lost over the last two decades,” he said.\nStill, our analysis also reveals the acceleration of a another, more concerning development. Out-of-state investors have continued their rapid acquisition of Milwaukee homes in recent years, even as purchases by local landlords have tapered off. Housing advocates and previous research find that the investors typically rent their properties for amounts well above what a homeowner would pay in monthly costs.\nThese out-of-state investors now own 7,170 single family homes, condos, duplexes or triplexes across the city, up from 5,250 at the end of 2018. This category of ownership has grown by 50% since 2017 and 476% since 2005.\nToday, more than one in six Milwaukee rental homes is owned by a landlord based outside Wisconsin.\nThe outcome of the growing competition between working-class residents and out-of-state investment companies has long-term implications for Milwaukee, affecting the pool of affordable houses available in the city, housing costs, wealth creation, and neighborhood stability and social cohesion.\nIn short, the stakes are high, with hopeful homebuyers also facing new pressures from rising interest rates and an uncertain economic outlook."

In May, Kirk bought an $85,000 four-bedroom bungalow on 30th Street south of Hampton. Quiet and tree-lined, the block features homes that are still mostly owner-occupied.\n“I wanted to be in this neighborhood,” Kirk told us during a recent visit to his home. “I’ve got roots in this neighborhood.”\nKirk had grown weary of his former two-bedroom apartment in what he called a “not so peaceful” area on the west side. With a wry smile, he said he had become “a landlord in training” because he had to do basic maintenance and repairs on the unit that his landlord refused to do.\nStill, buying a home wasn’t easy.\n“It was always a dream, but I had a bunch of hurdles,” he said.\nFor the last two years, Kirk has been center manager for the Repairers of the Breach shelter for homeless adults at 13th and Vliet. But sitting on the couch he had just purchased for his new home, Kirk talked candidly about the struggles in his early years, both legal and financial.\nTo qualify for home ownership, Kirk worked with the non-profit Acts Housing for two years, which helped him resolve his financial issues and prepare him for buying a home. He received assistance with a down payment from various grant sources, including his mortgage provider, Johnson Bank, and a state housing program. Financial assistance is often necessary because of the city’s racial wealth gap and housing rehab costs. It’s proven to be a good investment. Acts itself has made more than $5 million in mortgage loans since 2013. Only $30,000 of that total have been charge-offs, where repayment is questionable.\nToday, Kirk is paying $720 a month for his mortgage, taxes, and insurance. Comparable homes will often rent for hundreds of dollars more. What seemed impossible decades ago is now a reality.\n“I said to anybody and everybody, it’s possible for me and for anyone to set a goal,” Kirk told us."

    "text": "An uptick in each of the city’s aldermanic districts\nTommy Kirk’s home purchase was one of 800 facilitated by Acts Housing in Milwaukee over the last four years. Our research suggests that its work and that of other non-profit organizations, the city of Milwaukee, and Milwaukee County are making a difference.\nOwner-occupancy has increased in each of the city’s 15 aldermanic districts. The largest increase in the number of owner-occupied houses occurred in the 10th and 5th districts, on the far west and far northwest sides of the city. Compared to 2018, there are now 350 more owner-occupants in the 5th district. There are 280 additional owner-occupants in the 10th.\nAt the neighborhood level, 13 neighborhoods saw at least another 5% of their total housing stock become owner-occupied. They include Murray Hill and Riverside Park on the east side, Southgate on the south side, Martin Drive and Miller Valley on the near west side, Lenox Heights on the west side, and Florist Highlands on the far northwest side.\nHomeownership grew the least on the near south side.\nNo neighborhood of at least 100 houses saw more than a 4% decline in owner occupancy. Only three neighborhoods saw a double-digit decrease in the number of owner-occupied parcels. The biggest was in Franklin Heights, the neighborhood surrounding the former A.O. Smith plant south of 27th and Capitol, where there were about 40 fewer owner-occupants.\nBut just as the number of owner-occupants has increased in the city, so has the number of purchases made by out-of-state real estate investment companies. Our analysis shows that the investors have almost exclusively targeted majority-Black neighborhoods, with the growth concentrated in a third of the city’s 15 aldermanic districts. All are on the north side.\nIn the 7th district, 1,100 houses are owned by an out-of-state landlord, an increase of 450 since 2018.\nIn the adjacent 1st district, 1,080 houses are owned by an out-of-state landlord, an increase of 440 since 2018.\nOut-of-state landlords also own more than 700 homes in each of the 2nd, 15th, and 6th districts.\nAcross these five districts combined, more than 4,500 houses are now owned by out-of-state investors, a 62% increase since 2018.\nPut another way, an additional 1,900 homes in majority Black neighborhoods are now owned by companies with business headquarters outside Wisconsin.\nThat trend simply hasn’t happened in majority white neighborhoods, where the number of houses owned by out-of-state landlords fell by nearly 100. Majority Hispanic neighborhoods have seen relatively little activity by these investors.\nIn neighborhoods like St. Joseph and Harambee, the pace of out-of-state investment and home ownership is closely matched. Out-of-state investors are in the lead in Sherman Park, Uptown, Silver Spring, and Old North Milwaukee. In contrast, homebuyers in Riverwest, Jackson Park, Bay View, and Washington Heights have faced relatively little competition from outside investors.\nThree companies now account for 20% of all out-of-state owned rental properties. In 2018, they owned just 2%. Collectively, VineBrook Homes of Dayton, Ohio, Highgrove Holdings of Torrance, Calif., and SFR3 of Mill Valley, Calif., owned more than 1,400 houses as of mid-2022. They owned just 83 at the end of 2018.\nAll three of these private equity-backed companies were profiled in the spring of 2021 by the Lubar Center and Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Since then, they’ve rapidly expanded their portfolios.\nSFR3 and VineBrook largely purchase single family homes to be used as rentals. The typical value of the home is about $100,000. The most current available data shows VineBrook owns 908 homes in Milwaukee. SFR3 owns 255. Nearly all VineBrook and SFR3 properties are north of Capitol Drive and west of N. 35th Street.\nHighgrove’s investments follow a different profile. It buys mostly duplexes with a median value of $50,000. The California firm now owns 279 properties in Milwaukee. Highgrove’s properties mostly fall within the near north side: south of Capitol, east of Sherman Boulevard, and west of Holton Street.\nWhile encouraged by the increase in owner-occupancy in his city, Johnson is concerned about the growing number of properties now in the hands of out-of-state investors.\n“Out-of-state investors are far less likely to care about a neighborhood,” the mayor said. “They are less likely to get involved in civic life.\n“I want neighborhoods to have stability, and transient renters don’t offer the same stability that homeowners provide. When neighbors have a sense of permanence, when they know each other, and when they care about the neighborhood’s future, that makes the entire city stronger and safer,” Johnson said.\nOn their websites, the large out-of-state investors say that they are meeting an existing need for quality, affordable rental options and providing needed investment in aging houses. Some renters may not want to buy but still want to live in a single-family home or duplex. Others don’t have the money for a down payment.\nBut as our previous reporting suggests, investment in cities such as Milwaukee is also highly profitable. That attracts private investors, which allows the larger firms to mostly pay cash for their purchases. An increasing number are bulk purchases of multiple properties all at once.\nAs the Milwaukee housing market got hotter and hotter, housing prices continued to climb. Zillow’s Home Value index placed the typical Milwaukee home at $127,000 in June of 2019. It was $183,000 in June of 2022, an increase of 44% over three years.\nRecent increases in housing prices have dramatically reduced the pool of low-priced houses in Milwaukee. In 2018, half of all houses were assessed below $100,000. Today, 30% are. The pool of homes worth less than $50,000 is almost gone.\nIn a housing market where cash, speed, and scale are king, residents of more modest means are at a distinct disadvantage.\n“I like to think of them (out-of-state investors) as one of the new barriers to home ownership” Acts Housing senior vice president of real estate Dorothy York said.\nActs president and CEO Michael Gosman said the new market dynamics make the dream of purchasing a home less attainable.\n“We have families that lost out to investors even when investors were paying less,” he said."

    "text": "A key cog in Milwaukee’s affordable housing plan\nTo compete with the large out-of-state investment firms, the non-profit recently announced the creation of the Acts Homeowner Acquisition Fund. The ambitious $11 million program was formed with the support of the Community Development Alliance and is a key part of Milwaukee’s Collective Affordable Housing plan. To date, Acts has raised $3 million of its $11 million goal. It has grant requests pending with both the city and county.\nActs said the fund will allow it to create an expanded inventory of homes in the $90,000 to $140,000 range with monthly ownership costs of $900 to $1,200.\nYork will lead the effort to identify ownership opportunities. She said the fund will help level the playing field as the non-profit competes with out-of-state investors for available properties in the city.\n“We can compete with them on their own terms,” York said.\nThe competition between local and out-of-state interests is producing an all-hands-on-deck approach in the city, with government, non-profits, businesses, and philanthropies working together to address affordable housing issues.\nCommunity Development Alliance chief executive Teig Whaley-Smith said that nationally, there are at least two strategies used to mitigate what he calls “the negative impact of predatory acquisition of single-family homes and duplexes.”\nThe first is requiring that landlords offer properties to tenants before selling to other landlords. The second is using landlord licensing to discourage negligent landlords. But in 2017, the Wisconsin Legislature passed a law that prohibits the city from requiring landlord licensing.\nThe local efforts to reduce the impact of out-of-state investors also face another, newer obstacle. In the early 2010s, real estate investors commonly bought properties from distressed homeowners. In contrast, our latest research found that the new breed of private equity investors often acquires its properties from local and suburban landlords, whose numbers are now declining. Increasingly, these houses are sold in package deals and often for cash.\nIn 2022 alone, VineBrook has spent nearly $20 million buying 176 properties in 27 different bulk purchases, mostly from smaller, Wisconsin-based landlords. Some sales were large, like a 17-property $1.65 million deal with a Muskego-based landlord in May. Others were small, like a $194,000 purchase of two properties from a Milwaukee-based company in January. None required financing.\nThis kind of sale completely excludes hopeful homebuyers in the market, even though residents in these neighborhoods, most of them majority Black, could often afford the houses if they were priced individually."

    "text": "A persistent racial gap in mortgage recipients\nThe dynamics of the market contribute to an enormous racial gap between mortgage recipients in Milwaukee. Although the white and Black adult populations of the city are roughly equal, our research found that white mortgage recipients outnumbered Black mortgage recipients by a two-to-one margin. Still, that was progress from 2018, when the gap between white and Black recipients was more than three-and-a-half to one.\nWhaley-Smith said it’s important for the city to look at what’s happening through a racial equity lens. He said it’s no surprise that families are choosing Milwaukee to buy a home but said the owner-occupancy growth is still unequal.\n“Increased white home ownership is driving the overall growth, and although there have been hundreds of new homeowners of color, this growth has been wiped out by the predatory acquisition that is taking single family homes and duplexes off the market,” Whaley-Smith said.\nJohnson echoed that concern.\n“Homeownership is key to building generational wealth in this country, and I don’t want any Milwaukeean’s potential to build a better life for themselves and their family to be limited because of how hard it can be to buy a house when they’re ready for homeownership,” he said.\nAs interest rates rise, the impact on the struggle for Milwaukee’s heart and soul − its neighborhoods − is unclear. Historically low mortgage interest rates played a role in increased owner occupancy. Those rates are now less attractive for a working-class buyer. The private equity firms can pay in cash. Will that tip the balance in some neighborhoods, where both trends have been playing out?\nWhat is clear is that the competition between local buyers and out-of-state investors is real, urgent, and far from over. In the last 19 months, two of the houses on the block where Tommy Kirk now lives were purchased by an out-of-state investor."

    "text": "In the darkest days of the coronavirus pandemic, uncertainty ruled the day for Wisconsin businesses and workers. Even as vaccines were becoming widely available in the spring of last year, Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. Secretary Missy Hughes worried about the fate of the state’s many small businesses, especially those with fewer than 20 employees.\n“We’re potentially looking at losing 20 to 30 percent of these small businesses,” she warned during a virtual event with Marquette University Law School in March of 2021.\nToday, it appears that worst-case scenario didn’t materialize. In a recent interview with us, Hughes cited several encouraging signs, including a 42% increase in new businesses formed during the pandemic. A torrent of state and federal aid — WEDC alone gave grants of $600 million to small businesses — combined with the grit and creativity of owners and workers averted an economic catastrophe. While the virus remains a concern, the greatest challenges facing most businesses right now are workforce shortages and inflation."

    "text": "Milwaukee is on the mend, but with a ways to go\nHas the economy fully recovered, or have we settled into a kind of new normal? More specifically, how is the economy of the state’s largest city and most populous county, Milwaukee, faring more than two years after the start of the pandemic? With two-thirds of the metropolitan area’s approximately 1.5 million residents living in Milwaukee County, its performance remains central to the region’s economic vitality.\nNew analysis done as part of the Milwaukee Area Project at Marquette University Law School’s Lubar Center shows an economy on the mend, but not yet fully recovered from the pandemic’s fallout. Among our findings:\n\nThere does not appear to be a mass exodus from the labor force in the city of Milwaukee, but unemployment remains higher than it was before the pandemic.\nMilwaukee County saw the number of business establishments actually increase from 2019 to 2021, but the number of employees across nearly all major sectors of the economy was down from two years ago.\nEmployment in some industries declined in 2020 but began to rebound in 2021. Others declined two years in a row, suggesting longer-lasting changes to the local economy.\nEmployment in some of the county’s best-paying sectors had not recovered to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021. That includes manufacturing and the professional and business service sectors.\nAs expected, the leisure and hospitality industry was hardest hit by the pandemic. Employment declined by 31% from 2019 to 2020. The sector has recovered somewhat, but employment remains well below pre-pandemic levels.\nWhile restaurant employment fell, the total number of restaurants in the city of Milwaukee grew in 2021, a phenomenon fueled by strong growth among caterers and food trucks.\nBusinesses, non-profits, local governments, and individuals in Milwaukee County benefited greatly from the federal government’s financial assistance during the pandemic. For example, the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) sent $2.3 billion to employers across the county and $1.9 billion of that amount went to entities in Milwaukee.\n\nLet’s look at the employment picture first."

    "section": "Milwaukee unemployment rate is still relatively high",
    "text": "Milwaukee unemployment rate is still relatively high\nSince the Great Recession, Wisconsin’s unemployment rate has consistently been slightly lower than the national rate. But for decades, Milwaukee’s unemployment rate has been consistently higher than both the state’s and the nation’s. Far from changing this basic dynamic, the economic recovery appears to have exacerbated the gap between Milwaukee and the rest.\nIn May of 2019, prior to the pandemic, U.S. unemployment was 3.4%. It was 3.1% in Wisconsin and 4.2% in Milwaukee.\nUnemployment spiked for all three in 2020, as the pandemic took hold and governments took steps to address a public health emergency. In April of 2020, unemployment stood at 14.4% nationally, 14.1% in Wisconsin, and 16.7% in Milwaukee.\nBut by May of this year, the U.S. and Wisconsin unemployment rates had returned, or even improved on, pre-pandemic levels. Not so for Milwaukee. Its 4.9% unemployment rate was nearly a full percentage point higher than May of 2019.\nTo count as unemployed, people must be looking for work. People who have left the workforce entirely don’t factor into the unemployment rate. But our analysis does not suggest a mass exodus from the labor force. In fact, the city of Milwaukee’s labor force in May of this year was 273,000, slightly higher than in 2019.\nThe number of unemployed people in Milwaukee was estimated to be 13,300 in May of this year. That’s down from 20,000 in May of 2021, but still higher than any other year since 2016.\nOne striking finding of our analysis was that almost none of the sectors in the Milwaukee County economy had fully recovered from the pandemic. The best source for employment data by sector is the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. Because these reports have a six-month lag time, they do not capture the most recent changes in employment. But they do give us our best and most reliable sense of which parts of the local job market are growing and shrinking. The numbers are only available on the county level, and we only discuss private-sector workers — leaving aside government employment."

    "text": "Leisure hospitality workers hit hard\nNot surprisingly, the leisure and hospitality industry was hammered by the pandemic. Employment fell from 48,000 to 33,000 in the first year of the pandemic. As of December 2021, employment had only partially recovered to 42,000.\nRestaurant employees were hit especially hard. In the first year of the pandemic, full-service restaurants shed 33% of their workforce, nearly 4,900 workers. By December of 2021, just under 2,600 had been added back.\nLikewise, food service contractors lost about half their jobs in 2020, with only about half of that recovered in 2021.\nHigher paying occupations also struggled to return to pre-pandemic levels. The manufacturing sector in Milwaukee County saw employment decline by 4,000 in 2020, the first year of the pandemic, and 2021 showed a modest recovery of 700 workers.\nIn recent years, we have written about one of the bright spots in the Milwaukee economy, the growth of employment in the “management of companies and enterprises” sector in the last 20 years. New data suggests the pandemic may have interrupted or even halted that trend. During the first year of the pandemic, the number of employees in this industry fell by more than 1,000. The industry lost 400 more in 2021. Since these are generally prestigious, desirable, high-paying jobs, it raises the possibility that some of these positions are leaving Milwaukee entirely.\nOther continued employment declines in 2021 may reflect a tight labor market for certain kinds of workers, not a lack of open positions. For instance, employment in nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and home health care all fell in both 2020 and 2021.\nAs the pandemic forced Americans to change their shopping habits, employment in a few industries increased. The most dramatic example can be found in the general warehousing and storage industry. Employment has more than doubled since 2019, gaining over 2,500 jobs. The number of employees working in construction by the end of 2021 also grew, slightly exceeding its 2019 benchmark."

    "text": "Number of business establishments is up\nEmployment is one way to measure the recovery from the pandemic. Another is looking at the number of business establishments, or workplaces. Perhaps counterintuitively, the number of establishments grew while employment fell.\nSometimes, this reflects changes in where people worked. The federal Department of Health and Human Services used pandemic relief funding to encourage growth in home-based care for the elderly and disabled. Similarly, the number of child day care establishments grew even while employment in these places fell. Possibly, this reflects a growing preference for smaller providers.\nOther cases of substantial establishment growth were among professionals and skilled trades, often related to shipping or housing, including marketing consultants, real estate agents, truckers, home remodelers, insurance agents, landscapers, and drywall contractors.\nStarting a business during a pandemic takes a lot of planning, and a leap of faith. But some entrepreneurs did just that in 2020 and 2021, even in the kinds of service sector industries most disrupted by the pandemic. With the help of the Milwaukee City Clerk’s office, we created a unique dataset by matching business license recipients for tavern, restaurant and grocery activities in the city.\nAfter a decline in 2020, most of those businesses showed a strong recovery in 2021. Compared to 2019, there were 6% more restaurants at the end of 2021. That was driven by strong growth among caterers and mobile food trucks. These two categories grew 47% since the pandemic began.\nThe ranks of large grocery stores were largely unaffected by the pandemic.\nA few gas stations closed in 2020, but their numbers recovered in 2021.\nConvenience stores recovered incompletely in 2021, but the data suggests their decline may predate the pandemic.\nBars and coffeeshops have struggled. The number of taverns — drinking establishments that don’t serve anything more complicated than frozen pizza — fell in both 2020 and 2021.\nLikewise, a half-dozen coffeeshops closed in 2020, with no recovery in 2021."

These areas were also hard hit by the housing crisis of the Great Recession.\nWith fewer people working in office towers and less street traffic, the 4th aldermanic district downtown also saw a decline in these kinds of licenses.\nIn contrast, Milwaukee’s 14th district, home to the Bay View neighborhood, saw an increase in licenses for restaurants, coffee shops and grocery stores.\nEven more entrepreneurial activity occurred in Milwaukee’s 7th aldermanic district during the last two years. Located on the north side and including the Sherman Park neighborhood, the 7th added 31 new licenses, the vast majority for new restaurants.\nDigging a little deeper, the 7th saw an increase of at least 14 catering businesses and five mobile restaurant bases (the kitchen associated with one or more food trucks).\nMuch of this burst of entrepreneurial activity can be attributed to Upstart Kitchen, a food business incubator which offers commercial kitchen space to new businesses. The shared space at 43rd and Fond du Lac is located less than a mile from the Sherman Phoenix development, which has been another source of small business growth in the 7th district."

    "text": "Billions in federal dollars flow into the region\nAs we wrote this piece, we couldn’t help but wonder about the local impact of federal assistance received during the pandemic, an impact that can now be measured in the billions of dollars. Here are numbers from a few of the biggest aid programs. To help give a sense of scale, total wages paid by all nonfarm employers in Milwaukee County added up to $26.9 billion in 2019, $26.7 billion in 2020, and $28.3 billion in 2021.\nUsing census data to find the eligible population, we estimate that Milwaukee County residents received about $2.2 billion directly from the three pandemic-related stimulus checks. Expanded child tax credits in 2021 paid Milwaukee County families around $240 million in total.\nOur calculations suggest that the various temporary expansions of federal unemployment benefits added over $700 million to the checks of unemployed Milwaukee workers across the 1.6 million weekly claims made during the eligible months. Emergency rent relief in Milwaukee County totaled about $60 million through the first half of 2022.\nOther stimulus efforts supported the private sector. The largest was the Paycheck Protection Program, which allowed small businesses to apply for low-interest (often forgivable) loans that could be used to cover payroll costs, rent, interest, and utilities.\nData from the Small Business Administration indicates the PPP paid out $2.3 billion to Milwaukee County businesses and non-profits, of which $1.9 billion went to the city of Milwaukee. $1.7 billion of the citywide loans have been forgiven.\nThe majority of PPP loans made to Milwaukee businesses appears to have gone to individuals. Of the more than 25,000 loans made in Milwaukee, 55% went to either sole proprietorships, independent contractors, self-employed individuals, or single member LLCs.\nCollectively, these recipients got $222 million in loans, of which $143 million has been forgiven to date. This rate of loan forgiveness — 64% — is much less than the rates achieved by other kinds of borrowers. For example, the forgiveness rate for corporations is 96%.\nMost of those corporations obtained their loans with the help of well-known banks. In contrast, thousands of the loans to individuals were processed through less well-known financial institutions located in places like California, Arizona, and Florida. Some of these loan originators have forgiveness rates as low as 49%.\nThe role government played in responding to a deadly virus will be debated for some time. What can be said is that the worst fears of top state officials were not realized.\nIn Milwaukee County, two years after the pandemic began, most Milwaukee County businesses are still in business. In fact, there are more business establishments today than there were two years ago.\nBut that masks the other story revealed by the data: At the start of this year, nearly every major sector of the local economy had fewer total employees than before the pandemic began. In Milwaukee County, at least, the recovery remains a work in progress."

    "text": "Wisconsin Voter Turnout\nFirst, here are some basic facts about voter participation in Wisconsin. Turnout has consistently been very high in this state—typically among the highest in the country.\nOpponents feared that the introduction of the photo ID requirement would reduce turnout. This does not appear to have happened, at least in a long-term way.\nIn 2008, 69.8% of adults voted. This fell ever-so-slightly to 69.6% in 2012. Then, turnout dropped much more noticeably in 2016, down to 66.5% of adults. Voters became much more engaged after Trump’s first election. Turnout jumped to 71.8% of adults in 2020.\nDespite a national decline in voter turnout in 2024, it grew in Wisconsin to 72.8% of adults. Turnout was probably highest in Wisconsin out of all 50 states, whether measured as a share of all adults or voting-eligible adults.\nMidterm voter turnout grew even faster than presidential turnout after the introduction of the photo ID requirement. Before the requirement, in 2010, 49.9% of adults voted. In 2014, 54.4% participated, growing to 58.8% in 2018. Turnout dipped to 57.7% in 2022.\n\n\n\nConcerns about the impact of the photo ID law were particularly high in Milwaukee. Here, turnout dropped from 2012 to 2016 in presidential elections but grew in midterm elections from 2014 to 2018.\nThese overall turnout trends do not preclude the possibility that turnout would’ve been even higher in 2024 without a photo ID law. But they do imply a fairly low ceiling on the size of such an affect. The share of adults participating in Wisconsin’s democracy has probably never been higher than in the late 2010s and early 2020s, when they were also among the highest rates recorded by any US state since at least 1980.2\n2 See voter turnout rates as a share of the voting age population published by Michael McDonald."

    "section": "Current Photo ID Holders by Age",
    "text": "Current Photo ID Holders by Age\nThe circa 2011 estimates of people without a photo ID were mostly based on comparing the names in the registered voter database with the names in the DMV driver license database. That approach won’t work anymore, even if one had access to the DMV database (I don’t). Today, if you’re registered to vote in Wisconsin, you almost certainly also hold a photo ID.3\n3 One must present proof of residence in order to register to vote, which could be a current photo ID but could also take the form of, e.g., a utility bill. A photo ID is only required in order to request a ballot. Wisconsin’s voter roll maintenance stipulates that, following each general election, postcards are mailed to every registrant who hasn’t voted in the past four years. If the registrant fails to return the postcard, they are struck from the voter rolls. So, technically, it would be possible for someone without a photo ID to register to vote, never actually cast a ballot, but remain on the voter rolls by faithfully returning the maintenance postcard every two years.Instead, I obtained an aggregated dataset of ID holders by age from the Wisconsin DMV. It includes all kinds of IDs issued by the DMV (not just driver licenses). It does not include other permissible photo IDs, like tribal and student IDs.\nMy data shows the number of DMV photo ID holders in early 2025. In the chart below, I compare those totals for every year of age, 14 through 84, with our best estimate of the number of Wisconsin residents who were that age in January 2025.4\n4 I leave the 85+ population off the graph because that population estimate is given as a total and not by single year of age. The relationship of IDs to population is the same for this age bracket as for other older adults. After adjusting the 2023 population estimates for age specific mortality rates, I estimate that 120,800 adults age 85 and older lived in Wisconsin in January 2025. At that time, there were 121,500 DMV IDs issues to people in the age bracket.The number of ID holders is shown in red and the population estimate is shown in blue.\nAbout 4% of 14 year-olds hold state ID cards, but the number increases rapidly with each subsequent teenage year. The number of 18 year-old ID card holders is 90% of the estimated 18 year-old population, and this grows to 98% among 24 year-olds. Recall, of course, that many of these young people are college students, and many student ID cards can be used to vote.\n\n\n\nAfter age 24, something interesting happens in the data. Among those ages 25-42, the number of ID card holders noticeably exceeds the total population. The difference peaks at age 33, among whom there are 75,300 residents and 81,700 ID holders.\nThis excess in ID card holders is evidently the result of population mobility among young adults. The likelihood of moving out of Wisconsin peaks in the late-teens-to-early 30s. When such a person moves from Wisconsin to, say, Minneapolis, their existing ID card does not automatically or immediately expire.\nInitial Wisconsin driver licenses last 2 years and renewed licenses expire 8 years after the recipient’s next birthday. So someone who renewed at age 20, then moved out-of-state after college graduation, would potentially be counted as a current Wisconsin photo ID holder until age 28, at least so long as they avoided getting a driver license in their new state.\nWisconsin participates in something called the “State to State (S2S) Verification Service,” along with 41 other states and the District of Columbia. This program alerts state DMVs when a person holding a license in one state receives a license in another (they match on SSNs). The goal is to prevent people from holding licenses in multiple states at once.\nNotably, Illinois is not a member of S2S (probably related to its still ongoing struggle to become real ID compliant). So Wisconsinites who move to Illinois will likely remain on the list of Wisconsin ID holders for longer than those moving into another neighboring state.\n\n\n\nFrom the mid-40s onward, the number of DMV ID holders and the actual population converge. The degree of correlation is striking.\nIt’s not just that the general trends are similar. Even abrupt changes are matched in the two data sources. For example, the estimated population falls slowly between ages 75 and 77, sharply from 77 to 79, and slowly again from 79 to 80. This exact pattern is the same in both the population estimates and the ID counts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAge\nPopulation Est.\nID Holders #\n\n\n\n\n75\n53,638\n53,678\n\n\n76\n50,074\n50,654\n\n\n77\n49,642\n49,785\n\n\n78\n42,282\n42,502\n\n\n79\n33,346\n33,773\n\n\n80\n32,109\n32,298\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the number of ID holders still slightly exceeds the population for each age. This reflects, I believe, an unavoidable delay in processing death certificates plus the continued effect of IDs expiring after their holder has left the state."

    "section": "How Many Adults Lack an ID?",
    "text": "How Many Adults Lack an ID?\nWhat we’d really like to know is the number of valid DMV ID cards held by a current resident of Wisconsin. Nobody knows this statistic, but we can estimate its lower bound.\nEach year, the Census Bureau estimates the number of people who moved out of Wisconsin in the previous year.5 It bounces around a bit from one year to another, but typically about 10,000 18 or 19 year-olds and 83,000 adults age 20 or older leave the state.\n5 These numbers are collected by the American Community Survey (ACS). The 2024 estimate is unavailable, so I substituted the average of 2022 and 2023. No 1-year estimates were published for 2020 (due to pandemic disruptions to data collection), so I substituted the average of 2019 and 2021.Standard licenses last for 8 years after your next birthday and initial (or “probationary”) licenses last for two. Knowing this, we can estimate how many recent movers would hold an unexpired Wisconsin ID, if that ID remained valid until its scheduled expiration date.\nFor the purposes of this calculation I assume that every 18 or 19 year-old mover held a probationary license and every other adult held a full driver license (an overestimate, no doubt). I further assume that people leaving Wisconsin do so randomly with regard to their ID card’s expiration date. Someone leaving the state is equally likely to hold an ID card that they renewed 1 year ago as they are to hold a card expiring in 1 year.\nConsequently, I estimate that three quarters of the 76,000 people (age 20 and older) who left the state 2 years ago still hold a DMV ID card that has not yet reached its printed expiration date.\nAdding up each year’s fraction of the movers still holding an “unexpired” ID, I get an estimate of 304,000 “unexpired” DMV ID cards actually belonging to someone who no longer lives in Wisconsin.\nSubtracting this number from the count of adult DMV IDs, we get 4.43 million ID card holders, or 94% of the state’s adult population of 4.72 million. By this measure, 290,000 adults (6%) would lack a DMV-issued ID card.\nOf course, this is the outer boundary of estimates for the non-ID-having population. The actual number must certainly be lower—possibly much lower—thanks to Wisconsin’s participation in the S2S system.\nWhen our hypothetical twenty-something moves to Minnesota after college, their Wisconsin ID will only last until they receive a Minnesota ID to replace it. How long they wait before applying for this ID is unknown. I can find no statistics from the S2S system reporting the number of matches they process.\nAnd we have the issue of Illinois. The Census Bureau estimates that 14,000 people (of any age) made the move from Wisconsin to Illinois in 2023.6 Thanks to Illinois’ lack of participation in the S2S system, these movers are probably more likely to remain on the books in Wisconsin.\n6 27,000 moved the other way, from Illinois to Wisconsin.All of this is to say, the plausible share of adult Wisconsin residents without a DMV-issued ID lies somewhere less than 100% and greater than 94%."

    "section": "What Predicts Fewer ID Holders?",
    "text": "What Predicts Fewer ID Holders?\nThe population without a DMV ID card is evidently small, but it could be concentrated among particular groups of people. To measure this, I designed a linear regression model predicting the ratio of ID holders per 100 adults in each census tract. The dependent variable is adult ID holders as a percentage of the adult population and the independent variables are listed with their coefficients in the table.\nNaturally, the largest predictor of more IDs is movers out of Wisconsin. For every 1 percentage point increase in the share of the population who left Wisconsin in the previous year, the number of IDs per 100 grows by 1.6.\nThe opposite is also true. If more people in the tract are recent arrivals to Wisconsin, the tract has fewer ID cards. As expected, ID cards are also less common in places with more college students and 18-19 year-olds. (Some of these will have student IDs that allow them vote.)\nMore concerning is the effect of poverty. The number of IDs per adults declines by 0.24 with every 1 point increase in the share of adults living below the poverty line.\nA 1-year increase in the median age has a similarly-sized positive effect in increasing the number of ID holders.\nAll else being equal, a 1 percentage point increase in the Black and Asian populations is associated with 0.27 and 0.18 point increases, respectively, in the share with a photo ID.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Characteristic\n      Beta\n      95% CI1\n      p-value\n    \n  \n  \n    Black %\n0.27\n0.23, 0.31\n&lt;0.001\n    Asian %\n0.18\n0.03, 0.33\n0.019\n    Native American %\n0.02\n-0.11, 0.14\n0.8\n    Hispanic or Latino %\n-0.06\n-0.15, 0.03\n0.2\n    Other or multiple races %\n0.01\n-0.11, 0.12\n&gt;0.9\n    College student %\n-0.61\n-0.72, -0.50\n&lt;0.001\n    Moved to WI %\n-0.59\n-0.86, -0.33\n&lt;0.001\n    Moved out of WI %\n1.6\n0.87, 2.4\n&lt;0.001\n    Households w/no car %\n-0.09\n-0.20, 0.02\n0.11\n    Below poverty line %\n-0.24\n-0.34, -0.13\n&lt;0.001\n    Median age\n0.21\n0.08, 0.34\n0.002\n    Non-citizen %\n-0.08\n-0.27, 0.12\n0.4\n    18-19 years old %\n-0.44\n-0.62, -0.27\n&lt;0.001\n  \n  \n    \n      R² = 0.482\n    \n    \n      All percentages reflect the share of the adult population except for 'no car,' which is the share of households.

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nThe great majority of Wisconsin adults hold a photo ID card from the DMV. The total number of ID holders exceeds the adult population because ID cards often expire years after the holder moved out of the state. After estimating the number of unexpired IDs attributable to those who’ve left the state, I estimate that fewer than 6% of adult Wisconsin residents may lack a DMV photo ID card.\nA regression analysis suggests that the adults least likely to hold an ID card are those in their late teens, college students, and new arrivals to the state. College students commonly receive photo IDs which can be used to vote and new arrivals likely just haven’t gotten around to updating their DMV registration.\nThis leaves young adults who aren’t enrolled in college and adults living in poverty as the two groups most likely to be harmed by the photo ID requirement for voters.\nWisconsin’s voter turnout rates have continued to climb since implementing a photo ID requirement for voters prior to the 2016 election. In 2024, Wisconsin actually had the highest voter turnout rate in the nation. This likely reflects government efforts to make voter ID cards freely available with minimal paperwork, and successful efforts to help more people apply for those cards. Nonetheless, it remains the case that young and poor people are less likely to have a photo ID, though this is not true of racial minorities according to the regression analysis."

That appointed justice then stands for election in the first year “when no other justice is to be elected,” per Wisc. Stat. 8.50(4)(f)1.\nConsequently, if Janet Protasiewicz (elected in 2023) were to resign (or otherwise leave office), the governor’s appointed replacement would serve until an election in 2031.

    "text": "How this court got here\nSpring elections in Wisconsin can feature an eclectic mix of offices including judicial races, school boards, the state superintendent, constitutional referendums, and presidential primaries. The specific set of races on the ballot varies each year.\nEven with this variation, there is a clear trend of growing participation in SCOWIS elections.\nThe following table shows the results of the races that elected each of the current seven justices.\n\n\n\ntable showing turnout in SCOWIS races from 2015 to 2023\n\n\n\nJust 18% of adults voted in 2015, when Anne Walsh Bradley was last reelected.\nThe next SCOWIS race coincided with the 2016 presidential primary. 47% of adults participated and the court result almost perfectly matched partisan primary participation. 52% of voters participated in the GOP primary and 52% voted for the conservative judicial candidate, Rebecca Bradley.\nIn a sign of their general disarray following Trump’s first victory, liberals in Wisconsin failed to field a candidate in the 2017 SCOWIS race. Annette Ziegler was reelected by the 18% of adults who participated. The other statewide race on the ballot was for school superintendent, which the future Democratic governor Tony Evers won with 70% of the vote. To me, this is the last spring election in Wisconsin to have actually felt relatively nonpartisan.\n22% of adults voted in 2018, when liberal Rebecca Dallet defeated conservative Michael Screnock by 11.5 points in an open race to replace retiring conservative Michael Gableman.\nThe 2019 race was also open, after longtime liberal justice Shirley Abrahamson retired. Conservative Brian Hagedorn narrowly defeated liberal Lisa Neubauer by 0.5 points in a race with 27% participation.\nThe 2020 SCOWIS race coincided with the presidential primary, but unlike 2016, there was no Republican primary and the Democratic primary was nearly over, (Biden’s last opponent dropped out a few days later). Turnout was 35% and liberal Jill Karofsky defeated conservative Dan Kelly by about 11 points.\nIn 2023, the SCOWIS race was the most prominent contest on the statewide ballot, and its consequences were widely understood: namely, majority control of the court. Turnout was 40%, higher than in any previous spring election not corresponding to a presidential primary. Conservatives once again ran Dan Kelly. He lost to liberal candidate Janet Protasiewicz by slightly more than his defeat to Karofsky in 2020.\n\nJust as turnout in SCOWIS races has gradually risen over the past decade, so has the degree to which partisanship shapes the outcomes. This graph, from my colleague Charles Franklin, shows the correlation between judicial votes and presidential votes in each county.\nIn 1978, the correlation between how a county voted for state Supreme Court and how it voted in the previous presidential election was 0.002. In 2016, it was 0.869. And in 2023, it was 0.964.\n\n\n\ndotplot showing the correlation between votes for SCOWIS and POTUS among Wisconsin counties"

The last time a state superintendent race overlapped with a contested SCOWIS race was 2013, but the stakes in this election seem more similar to 2023, when the outcome of the race would determine majority control of the court. Also like 2023, this race features candidates who voters can easily connect to policy positions on hot topics like abortion access and redistricting.\nBeyond its policy consequences for Wisconsin, this race will be a test of a leading theory about the 2024 election—that Democrats are the off-year party now. Republicans, the theory goes, win with voters who are less likely to participate in non-presidential contests. The reverse used to be true, with Republicans more often winning low turnout elections.\nIf Crawford wins, it will bode well for Democrats hoping to win a trifecta in Wisconsin in the 2026 midterms. A Schimel victory would suggest that conservative support is more vigorous and reliable than the Trump-specific low propensity voter narrative suggests."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Cities are always evolving. Like the people who call them home, they experience highs and lows, moments of celebration and disappointment. Their economic fortunes rise and fall depending on factors both within and beyond their control. The constant is change. The challenge is to adapt.\nThat is certainly true for Wisconsin’s population center — Milwaukee and Milwaukee County. In the last 50 years, the state’s largest city and county underwent enormous change. To begin with, they shed thousands of residents. An estimated 916,000 people lived in Milwaukee County in 2023, roughly 125,000 fewer than 50 years ago. The population decline was driven by the city, which lost more than a fifth of its residents during the same period.\nSome of the changes are easy to see. We are a far more diverse area today than we were a half century ago. The city’s once-modest skyline now features several prominent high-rises. But one of the most significant changes that occurred is less obvious to the eye. We are talking about the evolution of a key social institution: the family.\nThe family in America changed significantly in the last half century. A 2023 Pew Research Center survey found that only about a quarter of Americans now see marriage and parenthood as key to a fulfilling life. People are marrying later, with fewer people marrying at all. Birth rates are falling.\nEach of those trends is playing out in Milwaukee, but on steroids.\nAs part of the Milwaukee Area Project, our continuing series of reports examining life in metropolitan Milwaukee, we examined data from the last 50 years with our focus on the family. Here is some of what we found:\nIn 1970, Milwaukee County was just completing a surge in population growth. Neighborhoods in the city and its suburbs were filled with children. 130,000 students attended Milwaukee Public Schools alone, most of them living in homes with parents who were married.\nToday, that is no longer the case. Take marriage rates, for example. To get the best detailed comparison, we examined microdata from the 1980 decennial census and from the 2017-21 American Community survey (reliable comparable microdata is unavailable in 1970). We found that the percentage of people who had never married grew sharply in Milwaukee County, far more than it did for the nation. That was true for all major racial and ethnic groups.\nWe looked at “never-married” rates for people ages 45 to 54. In 1980, 9% of Black Americans had never married. By 2020, the number had climbed to 31%. But in Milwaukee County, the increase was even more dramatic. In 1980, 7% of Black Milwaukee County residents ages 45 to 54 had never married. In 2020, that number was 47%.\nIn 1980, 5% of white Americans ages 45 to 54 had never married. By 2020, that number was 12%. But in Milwaukee County the never-married rate for whites 45 to 54 grew from 7% to 23%, or double the national average.\nThe same trend held true for Latinos in Milwaukee County. In 1980, the national never-married rate for 45- to 54-year-old Latinos was 7%. It grew to 16% by 2020. In Milwaukee County, the non-married rate grew from 6% to 26%.\nKnowing that marriage rates have declined does not necessarily tell you anything about living situations. An unmarried person may still be living with others, whether it be a romantic partner, family, or roommates. Many people raise kids without a spouse.\nWhat we do know is that the average household size is shrinking — particularly in the city of Milwaukee. In 1970, 48% of Milwaukee city households included at least three members, while 30% had two, and 22% had one.\nBy 2020, the share of households with at least three members had fallen from 48% to 34%. There were 113,000 households with at least three members in 1970, just 81,000 in 2020.\nIn contrast, one-person households grew by 62%, from 53,000 in 1970 to 86,000 in 2020. They now constitute 36% of all households in the city. In other words, single-person households outnumber households with at least three people.\nOther data comparisons further illustrate the stunning degree of change in the city in the last 50 years. In 1970, 62% of households included a married couple. Now, 26% do. In 1970, 40% of households included children. Today, 26% have kids living in the home. And 50 years ago, married couples raising kids outnumbered unmarried parent households by nearly five to one. In 2020, unmarried parents are far more common than married ones. More than 60% of households with kids are headed by a single parent or unmarried couple."

But one thing is certain. Families are having fewer kids. The number of babies born to Milwaukee mothers fell sharply during most of the 1990s, recovered somewhat in the early 2000s, and then plummeted again after the Great Recession of 2006. For example, there were 11,500 births in the city of Milwaukee in 2006 and 9,200 in 2019. There were fewer than 8,000 in Milwaukee last year, according to preliminary vital statistics records. The first three years of the 2020s set successive records for the fewest numbers of births in the city.\nThat has serious implications for school enrollment. Birth counts are a good predictor of subsequent first grade enrollment. But Milwaukee also experiences negative domestic migration among young families. More move away from the city than to it. If current trends continue, our analysis suggests that first grade enrollment will likely be about 6,400 five years from now. That is a decline of 20% from last year’s first grade enrollment of nearly 8,000. Again, those numbers are for school enrollment in all sectors — MPS, charter and voucher. Each will be fighting for a piece of a shrinking pie.\nThe changing household size in Milwaukee is also creating new housing market challenges and opportunities. During the 1970s, 80s and 90s, nearly two-thirds of new housing units were multifamily apartments. But detached single-family homes, duplexes and condominiums still made up a meaningful market share.\nIn the last 15 years, the market shifted hard to multifamily construction. Through the first four years of the 2020s, nine out of 10 new units have come in multifamily developments. It’s easy to understand why, given the changing household size in Milwaukee. But all that new apartment construction still hasn’t been enough to meet demand. Remember our finding that there are now 86,000 single-person households in Milwaukee? That compares to an available supply of roughly 52,000 studio or one-bedroom apartments.\nThe shrinking household size also raises a question: who will live in all those homes that were built for families decades ago?\nAnd, if you’re a family in Milwaukee looking for a new, detached single-family home, you’re essentially out of luck. Property records show that only 99 were built in the city from 2020 to 2023. New condominium construction also has halted.\nFinally, what do these trends, especially our declining birthrate, mean for the city’s efforts to grow its population to 1 million residents? It certainly doesn’t make reaching that goal any easier. As we’ve written, in Milwaukee’s case, growth might come from a combination of increased domestic migration and larger immigrant populations, who often have higher birth rates.\nStill, without thoughtful policy adaptation, falling birth rates and shrinking household sizes could feed a negative cycle, making Milwaukee less appealing to families.\nFalling birth rates complicate the finances of school systems that rely (partially) on per-pupil funding but maintain buildings that historically served larger student bodies. And the growth of one-person households understandably drives developers to mostly build small units. Larger, old houses are plentiful, but for those who prefer modern construction, options are slim. Because families are no longer the default kind of household, city policymakers, developers, and school officials will have to consider new ways of meeting their needs. While families now make up a minority of households, they are no less critical to the city’s future health.\nMilwaukee’s marriage and birth rates might be falling faster than the national average, but those trends are happening across the country and in virtually every wealthy nation. The status quo from 50 years ago will not return. The challenge for the next generation of local policymakers is to adapt — to foster communities that provide a high quality of life for singles, young and old alike, while also attracting and retaining families.\n(Data Note: Census tables and microdata were retrieved from the IPUMS NHGIS and IPUMS USA programs at the University of Minnesota.)"

    "title": "Donald Trump won 50 Wisconsin Assembly Seats. So Did Tammy Baldwin.",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Both Donald Trump and Tammy Baldwin translated their slender statewide victories into hypothetical 1-seat majorities in the Wisconsin State Assembly, each winning a majority of the vote in 50 of the chamber’s 99 districts.\nUnder the map used in the 2022 election, I estimate that Trump would have won a majority in 64 districts and Baldwin in just 36. The table below shows the outcome in various maps proposed during the 2022 and 2024 redistricting disputes.\nAlthough drawn by Gov. Tony Evers, the current maps are slightly less favorable to Assembly Democrats than the plans submitted to the Wisconsin Supreme Court by the progressive firm Law Forward and the Wright Petitioners.\nHowever, the current map is far more favorable to Democrats than the map drawn by Evers’ own People’s Map Commission. That group, which used a nonpartisan criteria, proposed a map under which Trump would’ve won 55 seats.\nOf course, actual Democratic candidates only won 45 Assembly seats, falling 4 seats short of the total won by Kamala Harris and 5 short of Baldwin. This is because Republican Assembly candidates were (with exceptions) more popular than Donald Trump.\nThe graph below shows how each Assembly race compares with the outcome of the presidential race in that district.\nFive GOP Assembly candidates won districts that Trump lost. They are as follows:\nOne Democratic candidate carried a seat that Trump won. Longtime incumbent Steve Doyle carried the 94th district (north of La Crosse) with 50.3% of the two-party vote, compared with 51.1% for Trump.\nThere were no split results in the State Senate. The closest race came in the 8th district, covering Milwaukee’s northern suburbs. Here, Democrat Jodi Habush Sinykin won 50.8% of the two-party vote, compared with Harris’ 51.2%.\nThis graphic also shows the 17 odd-numbered districts where elections will be held in 2026. They are visualized as empty circles, plotted at the zero point on the y-axis.\nOf the likely competitive seats in 2026, Harris and Baldwin both won all of them.\nDemocrats will need to win 3 of the 4 districts listed above to win a majority of the State Senate in 2026.\nAs the careful reader may have noticed, the current State Senate map actually has a structural advantage for Democrats. Despite losing the state by about a point, Kamala Harris won a majority of the vote in 18/33 Senate districts.\nThis table shows the number of senate districts won by Trump and Baldwin under selected alternative map proposals. Again, the difference is striking.\nUnder the map used in 2022, Trump’s narrow victory in 2024 was enough to win a supermajority of senate districts. Under the new maps, he wins fewer than half.\nUnder the nonpartisan People’s Map Commission, he would’ve won 21 of 33 seats.\nTwo common stories about the 2024 election are (1) that the election reflects a global anti-incumbent wave, and (2) that it was a reflection more of enthusiasm for Donald Trump than Republicans generally. Regarding the latter point, Wisconsin GOP strategist Bill McCoshen argued, “This was a Trump wave, not a red wave. And Republicans should be very careful how they interpret the results of this.”\nThere is good evidence in support of both those perspectives. It’s true that incumbent parties—left, right, and center—have lost elections across both hemispheres. Donald Trump has enjoyed electoral success by turning out infrequent voters who show up less reliably during elections when Trump isn’t on the ballot.\nStill, the data from Wisconsin’s state legislative elections show the limits of both those narratives. Of the 82 contested state assembly races, Donald Trump was more popular than the GOP assembly candidate in just 12. While incumbent parties and executives may be unpopular, some degree of incumbency advantage still clearly endures."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The state legislative districts Wisconsin adopted in February 2024 bear little resemblance to the maps used previously.\nAs I wrote at the time, the new map is more competitive: there are more seats either party could win, and those seats will determine who controls both chambers. It is also more contested. The number of districts drawing a candidate from both parties, and the number of party primaries drawing multiple candidates are both unusually high.\nThe contested nature of the new districts is the subject of this blog post.\nVoters in 82 Assembly districts (out of 99) will be able to choose between a Democrat and a Republican in November 2024. That is the highest number since at least 2010. In 2022, just 73 districts featured a candidate from both major parties.\nThe situation in the State Senate is different. Only 11 (of 16) races offer both a Democrat and a Republican. That is down from 12 (out of 17) in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeats contested by both parties\n\n\nWisconsin State Legislature\n\n\n\nassembly\nsenate\n\n\n\n\n2010\n68\n15\n\n\n2012\n72\n10\n\n\n2014\n47\n14\n\n\n2016\n50\n8\n\n\n2018\n61\n13\n\n\n2020\n79\n11\n\n\n2022\n73\n12\n\n\n2024\n82, 82\n11, 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the new map, many legislators found themselves living in new districts—sometimes along with other sitting incumbents. This big shakeup creates a lot of opportunities for contested primaries.\nTo see how this primary season compares to past years, I collected the election results from each August partisan primary beginning in 2012. Here are the results.\nGiven that there are 99 Assembly districts, there can be a total of 198 Democratic or Republican contested primaries. In 2024, there will be 46, up from 31 in 2022, 25 in 2020, and 17 in 2018. The last time we saw more contested primaries was 2012, when 45 featured at least two candidates.\nThe number of contested Republican primaries in 2024 is 2 more than in 2022. But the number of contested Democratic primaries grew from 8 in 2022 to 21 in 2024.\nFewer State Senate races feature competitive primaries. Out of 16 seats (32 potential primaries), only 4 are contested, 2 for each party. This is down from 7 in 2022 and 8 in 2020.\n\n\n\nbarplots showing the number of contested seats by party\n\n\nMost Wisconsinites live in a district that leans quite strongly toward one party or the other, so the partisan primary is often the most consequential state legislative race available to these voters. I was curious how many districts feature a contested primary from either party.\nBy this measure, 2024 is record setting, at least since 2012. Forty-five districts offer at least one contested Assembly primary. The next highest year is 2012, when 39 districts did so.\nAbout 60,000 people live in each district, so roughly 960,000 more Wisconsin residents live in a district with a competitive primary in 2024 than two years ago. Compared to 2018, 1.68 million more Wisconsinites live somewhere with a contested Assembly primary.\n\n\n\nbarplots showing the number of contested seats by district\n\n\nOf the 21 contested Democratic primaries, 9 are in southeastern Wisconsin (7 in Milwaukee County), and another 7 are in the greater Madison metro. Two are near Eau Claire, and one is in the newly Democratic-leaning district south of La Crosse. Districts along Green Bay and Lake Superior have also drawn multiple Democratic candidates.\nThe 25 contested Republican primaries include 9 in the north central and northwestern parts of the state. Another 7 contested districts are near Lake Winnebago, Brown County, Sheboygan, and Manitowoc. Finally, a set of districts in the more suburban areas of southeastern Wisconsin also feature multiple GOP candidates. None of the southwestern districts feature competitive Republican primaries.\n\nStatewideMilwaukee area\n\n\n\n\n\ncontested status statewide map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontested status statewide map\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo of the most interesting Assembly primaries are occurring in the Milwaukee metro, scarcely 20 miles apart. Each features an incumbent legislator who sits to the ideological fringe of their party, and each has drawn a challenger supported by more mainstream members of their party.\nThe 24th Assembly district leans Republican by about 20 points. It covers parts of suburban Menomonee Falls and Germantown in southeastern Washington County. The current incumbent is Janel Brandtjen who has “drawn national attention as one of the Wisconsin Legislature’s most prominent purveyors of conspiracies about the 2020 election.” Current Republican State Senator Dan Knodl has chosen to run instead in the 24th Assembly district Republican primary. Brandtjen has been endorsed by Donald Trump himself, while Knodl has drawn support from Americans for Prosperity-Wisconsin.\nThe 19th district features a politician about as far removed from Janel Brandtjen as possible. Incumbent Ryan Clancy is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America and a cofounder of the state Assembly’s two-member socialist caucus. He is endorsed by many of the state’s leading progressive organizations and some left-leaning Democratic legislators. His primary challenger is Jarrod Anderson, a self-described “pragmatic progressive” with endorsements from numerous local Democratic politicians including the mayor, the county executive, the chair of the county board of supervisors, and the district’s previous incumbent.\nBecause both of these districts are strongly partisan—Republican in one case and Democratic in the other—contested primaries like these give voters a uniquely consequential choice between actual alternatives. For outside observers, they offer a unique opportunity to view the relative strength of the political coalitions which make up each party’s base."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Wisconsin’s 2024 August partisan primary featured no competitive races for statewide office, but it did include many competitive legislative races and two referendums on proposed amendments to the state constitution. Both referendums, which were supported by the GOP and opposed by Democrats, failed. Legislative primaries around the state returned mixed signals about the strength of incumbency, experience, and candidate endorsements.\nStatewide, the two almost identical referendum questions lost, with just over 57% of voters casting a “no” ballot for each measure. They failed by a similar margin (about 56% “no”) in the 4-county Milwaukee metro.\nBesides the statewide referendums, each voter could also choose the partisan primary of their choice. The incentives to participate in a party’s primary can vary a lot from place to place, as sometimes only one party offers contested races. However, the balance of party participation in the August 2024 primary came fairly close to the balance of support for each party in the last November election.\nSupport for the ballot referendums trailed Republican primary participation across all three of the Republican-leaning WOW counties. In fact, the referendums actually lost in Ozaukee County by the narrowest of margins; 50.1% of Ozaukee county voters cast a “no” vote, while 53.4% voted in the Republican primary. By comparison, 55% voted for the Republican gubernatorial candidate in November 2022.\nThe opposite occurred in Milwaukee County, where 75% of voters chose the Democratic primary, but slightly fewer (71% and 72%) voted against the referendums.\nIn general, these results are consistent with nonpartisan elections. Without the formal cue of partisan affiliation on the ballot itself, votes tend to compress a bit at both ends of the political spectrum.\nPartisan primary results in the Milwaukee metro\n\n\nunofficial, election night returns\n\n\n\nprimary preference\nquestion 1\nquestion 2\n\n\ndem\nrep\nno\nyes\nno\nyes\n\n\n\n\nMilwaukee\n75.0%\n24.6%\n71.2%\n28.8%\n72.2%\n27.8%\n\n\nOzaukee\n46.3%\n53.4%\n49.9%\n50.1%\n49.9%\n50.1%\n\n\nWashington\n27.4%\n72.4%\n35.1%\n64.9%\n34.5%\n65.5%\n\n\nWaukesha\n38.5%\n61.3%\n43.0%\n57.0%\n42.9%\n57.1%\nThis map shows how every reporting unit (a ward or combination of wards) voted on the ballot questions.\nNotice the ongoing breakdown of Republican strength in Waukesha and Ozaukee counties.

The incumbent legislator, Ryan Clancy, is a member of the chamber’s 2-member Democratic Socialists caucus. He drew a more moderate challenger (Jarrod Anderson) with endorsements from several prominent local politicians, including the mayor and county executive. The race featured unusually large spending for an assembly primary–more than $60,000 on each side.\nClancy, the incumbent, won reelection with 55% of the vote, handily winning his home neighborhood of Bay View along with the less wealthy sections of the east side. Anderson won several of the district’s wealthier wards, along the lakefront.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 24th Assembly district featured a very different primary contest–albeit also one featuring a fringe and more moderate member of the same party. Incumbent legislator Janel Brandtjen was one of the state legislature’s most prominent election deniers following Trump’s 2020 loss. She even received Trump’s personal endorsement for reelection earlier this year. Ultimately, that was not enough for her, as longtime state legislator Dan Knodl handily won with nearly 65% of the vote.\nBrandtjen’s official incumbency status is a bit deceiving in this race. Due to redistricting, only slightly more than half the voters remained the same as in her 2022 election. Dan Knodl previously represented the entirety of the new 24th assembly district as a state senator. In this way, Knodl may have benefited from even higher name recognition than Brandtjen.\nBrandtjen’s loss despite receiving a Trump endorsement may also reflect the limits of Trump’s appeal in these suburban communities. Previous non-Trump-aligned Republican primary candidates including Rebecca Kleefish, Jennifer Dorow, and Nikki Haley all posted some of their best performances in the WOW county suburbs."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Many things affect a school (or district’s) enrollment, but the most important is simply how many children live there.\nIn Milwaukee, recent birth trends point to a future of dwindling class sizes, beginning in elementary school and working their way up through the higher grades. Absent a spike in the birth rate or a big change in migration, the three sectors—district, charter, and private—will find themselves fighting over a shrinking pie.\nAcross the 1990s, the number of babies born fell by 13%. Then, the trend stabilized, even growing slightly, until the Great Recession. 773 fewer babies were born in 2010 than 2009, and annual declines continued after that. From 2009 to 2019, the number of births fell by 17%.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused a drop in births similar to the Great Recession a decade prior. Births fell by 540 in 2020, 439 in 2021, and 358 in 2022. Losses stabilized in 2023, when the preliminary count shows 7,905 births, still 14% lower than prior to the pandemic.\n\n\n\nline graph showing the number of births to city of Milwaukee mothers\n\n\nDuring the 2010s, schools across all sectors reaped the benefits of Milwaukee’s stable birthrate during the 2000s. Many of the twelfth-graders who graduated this year were born in 2006. Since then, the annual number of births has dropped by 31%.\nIn the next graph, I compare the number of first graders entering any school in Milwaukee (district, charter, or private) with the number of babies born six years prior. Subsequent first grade enrollment is lower than births because more young families move out of Milwaukee than move into it. However, the size of the gap has remained fairly steady across the 19 school years for which I have data.\nIn every school year, the number of first graders enrolling has been 21% to 15% lower than the number of babies born 6 years ago. In other words, first grade enrollment has always been between 79% and 85% of the total births 6 years prior. In 2023-24, the figure was 83%, and in 2022-23, 81%.\n\n\n\nline graph comparing births with first grade enrollment\n\n\nBecause of this stable relationship between births and subsequent first grade enrollment, we can use recent births to forecast the size of future first grade classes.\nIn the 2023-24 school year, 7,956 kids enrolled in first grade at any school within city limits. Six years prior, about 9,568 kids were born in the city. The children who will enroll in first grade in 2029-30 have already been born. In Milwaukee, they number 7,902.\nIf Milwaukee retains young families at the best rate from our recent past, it would still mean a decline of 16% in the number of first graders over the next 6 years. Retaining families at the worst rate would result in a 22% reduction. The simple linear model I use in the above graph predicts a 19% drop.\nAgain, these predictions are not based on a forecast of future birth rates; they are based on the number of babies who have already been born. Some combination of retaining more young families and attracting more migrants (domestic and international) could alter this trajectory. But the current path clearly points to a drop of nearly 20% in the number of first graders by the end of the decade. That decline will then work its way through elementary, middle, and high schools over the 2030s."

    "text": "This article originally appeared in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n“Make no little plans. They have no magic to stir men’s blood…”\nWhen renowned Chicago architect and urban planner Daniel Burnham uttered those famous words more than a century ago, American cities were in a period of rapid growth.\nToday, some cities in the south and southwest are seeing their populations soar. But more than a few proud American cities are shrinking, shedding thousands of residents. Milwaukee is one of them.\nMayor Cavalier Johnson hopes to reverse that trend. More than 100 years after Daniel Burnham’s exhortation, Johnson is making big plans of his own.\nHe wants Milwaukee to grow. A lot.\nDuring his campaign for mayor, Johnson raised a few eyebrows when he talked about the city increasing its population to one million people, nearly twice its current size.\nIt is not just that Johnson wants Milwaukee to grow. He needs population and business growth to help relieve enormous pressure on the city’s long-term finances.\nBut you sense that Johnson’s moonshot for Milwaukee is about more than aspiring to grow; it is about inspiring a city to reimagine itself, to think differently about its future."

    "section": "‘The machine shop of the world’ was once one of America’s largest cities",
    "text": "‘The machine shop of the world’ was once one of America’s largest cities\nMilwaukee’s past is a colorful one, filled with periods of industrial innovation and political experimentation. In the first half of the 1900s, the city was known as “the machine shop of the world” and elected three socialist mayors.\nIt was also, for a time, one of the largest cities in America. Fueled first by German and Polish immigration and later by the arrival of Black families from the south, Milwaukee’s population reached its peak in 1960, when census data showed a city of more than 741,000 residents. That made it the 11th largest city in America. Today, it is 31st. Since 1970, except for a slight uptick in the early 2010s, the city’s population has been steadily declining.\nAccording to the Census Bureau, the city’s population fell 17,600 since 2010 to just over 577,000 in 2020.\nIn December, the city of Milwaukee filed a formal challenge to the 2020 census count, arguing the Bureau undercounted Milwaukee. It cited a number of reasons, including misplaced prisoners and 2,394 missed housing units. The Census Bureau has since agreed that about 800 incarcerated people were incorrectly counted outside the city, but they have not yet released on a decision on the housing units. After carefully reviewing the evidence, we conclude that a 6,000 person undercount is plausible. Serious concerns remain about undercounts of Black and Latino residents across the country, and it is possible that these Milwaukeeans were undercounted in both 2010 and 2020.\nNonetheless, even if the baseline counts are in error, the direction of population change is more certain. All the best data, including vital statistics and migration flows, points to a population decline in the city over the past decade.\nOur review of data since the 2020 census shows that downward trajectory accelerated during the pandemic. From the census in the spring of 2020 to July of 2021, the Census Bureau estimates the city’s population declined another 7,900.\nInterestingly, the metropolitan Milwaukee area’s population also fell during the pandemic period, with the Census Bureau estimating a decrease of 9,000 in the metro. That is the first decline in decades. It is unclear if the population loss during the pandemic reflects a temporary or more permanent change in how and where work is being done.\nStill, the optics of Milwaukee’s population decline can be deceiving. In some places, it looks and feels like the city is growing. The city saw an explosion of new apartment buildings and condominiums in the last two decades. The apartment building boom continues. Right now, construction is underway on a 44-story tower near the Milwaukee Art Museum. A 31-story apartment building is rising on the northwestern edge of the city’s Third Ward.\nThe number of occupied housing units in the city increased by 5,000 in the last decade. So, how can our population be declining?\nThe answer lies in shrinking household sizes in Milwaukee. Most of the new housing units in Milwaukee were smaller apartments with one or two people living in them. Citywide, the typical household size fell from 2.5 in 2010 to 2.39 in 2020.\nThat change is largely the result of declining birthrates in the last decade. Birth certificate records show that 117,000 babies were born to Milwaukee mothers in the 1990s, falling to 112,000 in the 2000s, and 98,000 in the 2010s.\nThe shrinking size of the typical Milwaukee household points to the challenges of changing the city’s growth trajectory.\nCities shrink because of two factors: negative natural change—more deaths than births—or net migration.\nFor now, Milwaukee still has more births than death, although that gap is rapidly closing. But we lost tens of thousands of residents to migration in the last decade."

    "text": "Many Midwestern cities experiencing population loss over decades\nMilwaukee is not the only Midwestern city to lose residents. In the last decade, Cleveland’s population fell 24,000 to 372,000. Only 30 years ago, Detroit had more than 1,000,000 residents. In 2020, it had 639,000, losing another 75,000 in just the last decade. St. Louis’s population declined by 18,000 to 301,000.\nOverall growth in the St. Louis, Cleveland, and Milwaukee metros was close to zero.\nBut population loss is not inevitable for older, Midwestern or industrial cities. After decades of declining population, places like Cincinnati and Buffalo experienced growth in the last decade. Cincinnati added 12,000 residents. Buffalo, 17,000.\nPopulation growth—both city and metro—was even greater in Kansas City, Indianapolis, and Columbus. Looking at just the cities (not the metros), Kansas City added nearly 50,000 residents in the last decade. Indianapolis grew by 67,000. The city of Columbus added more than 110,000 residents.\nAll three of those cities have several things in common. They have modest gains from international migration. With the possible pandemic-related exception of 2021, they have positive natural change (more births than deaths), although that is slowly dwindling.\nWhat sets them apart from Milwaukee, Cleveland, and St. Louis is domestic migration. While thousands of residents left Milwaukee, Cleveland, and St. Louis in the last decade, thousands more Americans were moving to Kansas City, Indianapolis, and Columbus."

    "section": "Milwaukee population loss, and growth, varies across the city",
    "text": "Milwaukee population loss, and growth, varies across the city\nStill, the story of population loss in Milwaukee is more nuanced than you might think. It is not a city-wide phenomenon.\nWe looked at population growth and loss by aldermanic district in Milwaukee (we did this by aggregating census blocks from 2000 into the district boundaries drawn earlier this year). In the last two decades there was significant population growth in three aldermanic districts, the 3rd (east side), the 4th, (downtown) and the 13th (far south side).\nThe 3rd and 4th districts grew because of strong demand for new housing units being built there. The 13th district grew by increasing its typical household size, likely the result of immigrant families moving into neighborhoods. Together, these three districts added more than 12,000 over the past 20 years.\nAnother three districts saw modest, but noticeable growth. They were the 5th (northwest fringe), the 8th (near south side), and the 11th (far southwest side). Together, these districts grew by about 4,500 residents over the last 20 years, in large part due to an increase in household sizes.\nThe 9th (far northwest side) and 14th (greater Bay View) stayed about the same in terms of total population.\nThe city’s remaining seven districts, all but one on the north side, account for all the city’s population loss. The 15th lost 23% of its population in the last two decades. The adjacent 6th district saw a population loss of 18%, followed by a 15% decline in the 7th, 10% in the 1st, and 8% in the 2nd.\nBoth the 10th and 12th districts declined 5%.\nAll told, these seven districts lost 12% of their population since 2000, a decline of 37,700 people. It is the result of shrinking household sizes and decline in the total number of households. Even among the remaining housing units, there are sky high vacancy rates.\nThe city argues that the 2020 census undercounted housing units in the 6th, 7th, and 15th districts on the near north side. If true, this still would not change the long-term trend. Our analysis shows that the population in these neighborhoods has been declining for decades—down by nearly 55,000 since 1980.\nThe dueling narratives—population growth and loss—tell us something about the opportunities for growth in Milwaukee, as well as the obstacles to achieving it."

    "section": "There are plenty of ideas for how Milwaukee can grow again",
    "text": "There are plenty of ideas for how Milwaukee can grow again\nSo, how could the city begin growing again? Here are some ideas popular with leading urban planners, designers, and policy experts. A number of them are already being pursued or explored by Milwaukee’s policymakers.\nThe city can start by continuing to encourage development where people want to live. Low vacancy rates indicate demand is still strong for housing in the downtown, east side, Walker’s Point, and Bay View areas.\nWhen possible, the city should encourage refugee and immigrant settlement. Parts of the far south side have seen population growth, in large part because of higher birth rates among immigrant families. For example, Buffalo attributes some of its recent population growth to new international arrivals in the city. Given shrinking household sizes among native-born Americans, immigration by larger families is the main way neighborhoods can grow without building more houses.\nMilwaukee can increase domestic migration by offering newcomers a city that is more pedestrian and bike-friendly, with more public spaces and easy access to transit options. Zoning changes can increase density in areas that have experienced population loss because of shrinking household size. Where housing is in demand, more of it should be built. At the turn of the 20th century, Milwaukee was one of the most densely populated cities in America. A return to its roots—with better planning—might be in order.\nBut even doing all those things, important as they are, still will not address the primary cause of Milwaukee’s recent population loss — depopulation of neighborhoods across the north side.\nThe community, including the broader metro, must reduce racial disparities. The city could stem much of its population loss if more residents — increasingly those of color — chose to remain in Milwaukee. Public investment should be prioritized for neighborhoods that have experienced decades of disinvestment and population decline.\nThe city should continue to build on the recent decisions by Fiserv and Milwaukee Tool to move their corporate headquarters and hundreds of jobs from the suburbs to downtown Milwaukee. Their relocations and Northwestern Mutual’s recent decision to move jobs from its Franklin campus to downtown serve as a powerful reminder of Milwaukee’s built-in recruiting advantage with today’s employers; the city is more attractive to a younger, diverse workforce, some of whom will want to live in the city, close to where they work.\nAnd Milwaukee can play to its other strengths. Our climate and access to abundant freshwater may blunt some of the worst effects of climate change. The quality of life available to middle class families is superior to that in many of the fastest growing cities, where cost-of-living increases outstrip the wages of most workers. For example, a recent study found that Milwaukee was among the most affordable metros for starting teacher salaries.\nStill, serious obstacles to population growth remain.\nAt the top of the list is public safety. The city has seen an epidemic of reckless driving and just recorded its third straight year of record homicides. Perhaps not surprisingly, the areas hit the hardest by the violence in Milwaukee have seen the greatest population decline. While some growing cities such as Kansas City and Indianapolis also have higher rates of violent crime, public safety plays an important role in why people choose to live in a city. It is worth noting that three of the most dangerous cities in America — Baltimore, Detroit, and Memphis — experienced some of the greatest population loss in the last decade.\nWithout new sources of revenue, Milwaukee will find it difficult, if not impossible, to provide quality services and amenities. And if basic services decline, Milwaukee is a less attractive place to live for current and potential residents who already pay one of the highest property tax rates in southeastern Wisconsin. Many other large cities have more revenue streams available to them.\nWhile Milwaukee offers a variety of educational options for families—public, charters, and vouchers—too many of the city’s schools struggle to meet basic academic achievement standards, a disincentive for families considering where to live.\nAnd finally, is there enough economic growth in Milwaukee to create population growth? As we have reported, metro Milwaukee recovered from the last recession more slowly than some peer cities, with many of the new jobs created in lower-wage occupations. As part of “The American Growth Project,” a recent study from the Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise at the University of North Carolina ranked the 50 largest cities (metros) by speed of economic growth in 2022. Milwaukee finished last.\nWhen we first wrote about stagnant population growth in metro Milwaukee a couple of years ago, some readers wondered whether growth was the best way to measure the vitality of a city.\nIt is a fair question. In the 2020 census, Pittsburgh was a city of about 300,000 people, less than half the size it was in 1950. It has reinvented itself as a major technology hub and ranks highly in surveys that measure quality of life. A smaller city, the argument goes, does not have to be lesser city.\nSo, which path should Milwaukee take?\nMayor Johnson is betting on growth. One million Milwaukeeans.\nCall it a bold vision for the future or an impossible dream. But if Daniel Burnham—the author of “make no little plans”—were alive today, you suspect he just might be smiling."

    "title": "Gunfire Trends in Milwaukee, 2017-2023",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A review of the Milwaukee Police Department’s call logs indicates that gunfire more than doubled during the pandemic in much of the city. At the same time, the likelihood any given gunfire incident was accompanied by a 911 call reporting “shots fired” declined on the north side, but not the south side. Data from the first 5 months of 2023 shows a modest decline in gunfire compared to the height of the pandemic-era violent crime wave, but levels remain much higher than 2019.\n\nThe trouble with just measuring reported crime\nMilwaukee’s use of ShotSpotter technology provides a unique opportunity to measure a specific kind of crime in a way that doesn’t entirely depend on crime reports. This is helpful because the likelihood that a given crime is reported to the police varies by time and place.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, violent crime spiked in many American cities. Milwaukee set three annual homicide records in a row. After recording 97 homicides in 2019, the city endured 190 in 2020, 193 in 2021, and 214 in 2022 (according to MPD annual reports). The previous record was 168 in 1991, when the city’s population was about 50,000 more than today.\nThe summer of 2020 also saw massive protests against police killings of Black Americans, following the murder of George Floyd by officers in Minneapolis. Estimates suggest that between 15 and 26 million adults participated in demonstrations across the country during May and early June, making them the largest in American history.\nLocal crime trends are almost always measured by counting police reports, but these are, by definition, merely reported crimes. The rate at which actual criminal incidents are reported to the police no doubt varies among communities, by type of crime, and over time. The intense scrutiny of policing during the summer of 2020 may well have altered many Milwaukeeans’ likelihood of contacting the police.\nThe pandemic crime wave coincided with increased controversy over policing, making the relationship between reported crime and actual crime rates even more uncertain. Still, we do have objective data on both occurences and reports for one type of crime–gunfire.\nShotSpotter uses a network of acoustical sensors to detect and triangulate the locations of gunshots based on the resulting soundwaves. The system covers only a portion of Milwaukee–one section on the north side and a smaller section on the south side. From a technical perspective ShotSpotter seems fairly accurate. An independent quantitative audit of company-provided data found the system was 97% accurate with about a 0.5% false positive rate.\nPolitically, ShotSpotter is more controversial. Various national organizations criticize the program as an expensive form of police surveillance with little evidence of actual reductions in violence. On the other hand, many local Milwaukeeans, including community activist Vaun Mayes, Director of the Office of Violence Prevention Ashanti Hamilton, and Chair of the Fire & Police Commission Ed Fallone all expressed at least qualified support for the program in recent interviews with the Shepherd Express.\n\n\nShotSpotter trends\nEvery time the ShotSpotter system reports a gunshot, it is logged into the MPD 911 call log under the code “SHOTSPOTTER.” When a human calls 911 to report gunfire, it likewise is logged with the code “SHOTS FIRED.” Each report includes a timestamp and address.\nAll call log data is published publicly, but the Milwaukee Police Department only keeps 1 hour of incidents online. I obtained records from local software developer Nick Gartmann, who maintains a public repository of historic MPD call logs. He generously provided data covering December 2016 through May 2023, with a few gaps of missing data. The Milwaukee Police Department refused to tell me the boundaries of the ShotSpotter coverage area, but a public information officer did confirm that the coverage area remained unchanged throughout this period. Using the addresses from the call log, I was able to reconstruct the ShotSpotter service areas as shown below.\nRoughly, the north side coverage area stretches from I-43 to about 50th St., between the Menomonee Valley to the south and Capitol Drive to the north. The much smaller south side coverage area stretches from about 9th St. to 27th St., from Greenfield Ave. on the north to somewhat south of Lincoln Ave.\n\nBeginning in the summer of 2020, the ShotSpotter data shows an enormous increase in gunfire on the north side coupled with a large increase on the south side.\nThe north side coverage area recorded an average of 16.1 shots per day in 2019, increasing to 29.6 in 2020 and 39.2 in 2021. Gunfire ticked down slightly in 2022, to 37.5 per day.\nThe south side coverage area is much smaller. It saw a daily average of 2.9 ShotSpotter reports in 2019. That increased to 3.8 in 2020 and 4.2 in 2021, before falling back to 3.8 last year.\nIn the month of May alone, ShotSpotter recorded 25 incidents per day on the north side in 2017, falling to 15 in 2018, and 16 in 2019. That jumped to 31 in 2020 and 46 in 2021, before dipping to 42 in 2022 and 36 in 2023. The pattern on the south side has been generally similar.\n\nIn 2023, ShotSpotter incidents through May are slightly down since last year in the north side and slightly up on the south side. Compared to Jan - May of 2019, ShotSpotter reports are still up by 172% on the north side, compared with a 48% increase on the south side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage ShotSpotter reports per day\n\n\nin City of Milwaukee coverage areas\n\n\n\nannual\nJan - May\n\n\nnorth side\nsouth side\nnorth side\nsouth side\n\n\n\n\n2017\n19.3\n3.2\n20.2\n2.9\n\n\n2018\n14.2\n3.3\n12.2\n3.7\n\n\n2019\n16.1\n2.9\n13.5\n2.5\n\n\n2020\n29.6\n3.8\n19.2\n2.5\n\n\n2021\n39.2\n4.2\n38.2\n4.1\n\n\n2022\n37.5\n3.8\n38.0\n3.5\n\n\n2023\n—\n—\n36.7\n3.7\n\n\n\nAnalysis of MPD call logs by John Johnson. Records are missing for some days, so this show the average for available days in each period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShotSpotter incidents vs. reports\nTo get a sense of how often gunshots identified by ShotSpotter also result in a 911 call, I applied the following simple test. I drew a circle with a half mile radius around the ShotSpotter alert location. Then, I checked if a contemporaneous 911 call for “shots fired” had occurred at any point inside that circle. To account for delays in the ShotSpotter upload process, I included any call that occurred within 10 minutes either before or after the ShotSpotter timestamp.\nThe graph below shows the results in the north and south side coverage areas for the past 7 years.\nOnly a small fraction of gunshots are reported to the police. Based on this analysis, just 5.1%, or about 3,300 out of 63,900 ShotSpotter reports since 2017 have been accompanied by a 911 call reporting “shots fired” within 10 minutes and half a mile of the identified location.\nIn 2017, similar shares of ShotSpotter reports resulted in 911 calls on both the north and south side coverage areas. Since then, the trajectories have diverged.\nOn the north side, the share of shots accompanied with a 911 call has declined every year beginning in 2019. The share of calls being reported has dropped from 5.7% in 2017 to 3.6% in 2023 through May. That’s a decline of more than a third.\nOn the south side, the share of ShotSpotter reports accompanied with a 911 call hovered between 5.1% and 6.2% throughout 2017-2022. Through May of this year, it has shot up to 7.6%. Through the first 5 months of 2023, gunshots appear to be twice as likely to result in a 911 call in the south side service area than the north side service area. That gap didn’t exist before the pandemic.\n\n\n\nImplications\nThis data reinforces the importance of remembering that crime reports are just that–incidents residents actively choose to report to the police. In conversation, I’ve heard from many Milwaukee residents that they rarely report gunfire and property crime to the police, simply because they view it as a pointless and frustrating waste of time. This data analysis indicates that (1) only a very small share of gunfire incidents are ever called in to 911, and (2) that small share has declined even further on the north side of the city, as the frequency of shootings more than doubled during the pandemic."

    "title": "The balance of power in Wisconsin’s Assembly under alternative maps",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Last year, Wisconsin’s Supreme Court ultimately chose a new state assembly map drafted by Republican legislators. The new map refreshed the notorious Republican gerrymander drawn a decade prior. In the November 2022 election, Republican Assembly candidates carried 64 of the 99 districts, increasing their share of the chamber by 2 seats.\nDemocrats won the other 35 seats. A Lubar Center analysis concludes that Democratic candidates most likely would’ve won 36 seats under the previous decade’s boundaries, 39 seats under the “least change” map proposed by Governor Evers, and 43 seats under the final map submitted by the People’s Map Commission (PMC).\nI modeled Assembly vote based on the results of the 2022 elections for Governor, US Senate, state Attorney General, and state Treasurer. Each party won two races, and the average of all 4 is a 0.6-point Democratic statewide lean. Despite this, the same model predicts that Republican Assembly candidates would receive 51% of the two-party vote (+2 points) if all districts were contested.\nRepublican assembly candidates generally outperformed their fellow Republican candidates for statewide office. While Assembly Democrats won 35 seats under the current map, Democratic Governor Tony Evers carried the vote in 39 seats. I calculate that Evers also won the vote in 45 of the previous decade’s districts, 47 of the seats proposed in Evers least change plan, and 53 of the seats drawn by the PMC.\nMuch has been written (including by me) about how Wisconsin’s political geography disfavors Democrats at the legislative level. Evers’ strong performance in the hypothetical districts drawn by the PMC is a demonstration of how this need not necessarily be the case. The PMC map would’ve translated Evers’ 51.7% of the statewide vote into victories in 53.5% of the Assembly.\nAs the table below shows, the PMC map would’ve been particularly responsive to political changes across the state. It’s helpful to compare the seats won by Ron Johnson (R) with Tony Evers (D) across the plans. Evers won the state by 3.4 points, and Johnson won it by 1 point.\nUnder the current districts, Johnson’s victory would’ve resulted in a 35D/64R Assembly, and Evers victory would’ve achieved an only slightly different 39D/60R split.\nThe past decade’s map was a bit more responsive. Johnson’s 1-pt statewide victory would’ve caused a 37D/62R Assembly and Evers’ 3.4-pt victory a 45D/54R outcome.\nUnder Evers’ proposed least change districts, Johnson would’ve carried 60 seats. Evers would’ve won 47.\nThe People’s Map Commission districts are the most responsive of this set to changes in the electorate. This map would’ve translated Johnson’s 1-pt victory into a 44D/55R chamber. And Evers’ 3.4-point victory would’ve been good for a Democratic majority in 53 seats.\nAgain, recall that Democratic Assembly candidates tended to be less popular than Gov. Evers.

Instead, I used the 73 contested Assembly elections to create a model that predicts Assembly vote based on the vote for Governor, Senate, Treasurer, and Attorney General. I don’t include incumbency as an independent variable, because incumbency would vary in unpredictable ways under alternative districts.\nThe modeling process involves two steps. First, I estimate the vote margin using a simple linear model as follows, where WSA, GOV, USS, WAG, and WST are the vote margins for Assembly, Governor, Senator, Attorney General, and Treasurer, respectively.\n\\[\n\\operatorname{WSA} = \\alpha + \\beta_{1}(\\operatorname{GOV}) + \\beta_{2}(\\operatorname{USS}) + \\beta_{3}(\\operatorname{WAG}) + \\beta_{4}(\\operatorname{WST}) + \\epsilon\n\\]\nSee this subdirectory for the code and results of these models.\nI use the predicted vote margin in the first model to create a dummy variable predicted_dem_win, with a value of 1 for a Democratic victory and a value of 0 for a Republican victory.

    "title": "A grasp on stable shelter: As the pandemic recedes, housing instability remains a big problem in Milwaukee",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This article originally appeared in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on July 8, 2021.\n“Without stable shelter, everything else falls apart.”\nThose words, written by sociologist Matthew Desmond in his Pulitzer Prize-winning book “Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City,” helped ignite a national conversation about the relationship between housing insecurity and poverty.\nBased on Desmond’s research and experience in the city of Milwaukee, “Evicted” was published in 2016. So, he began his national book tour here, with an appearance at Marquette University Law School.\nWhat Desmond, then at Harvard and now director of Princeton University’s Eviction Lab, told his audience on that late winter day was alarming. More: A surge in evictions is almost certain to happen when the moratorium ends. But the truth is they’ve been happening all along. More: A CDC moratorium on evictions ends July 31. Here is what is likely to happen next.\nIn poorer, Black neighborhoods in Milwaukee, one in 13 renters was evicted annually.\nOne in eight of all renters in the city experienced some kind of involuntary move every two years.\nOne in five Black women renters reported being evicted at some point in her life.\nDesmond said his findings and subsequent research had led him to a simple conclusion.\n“I’m convinced we can’t fix poverty in this country if we don’t address housing.”\nFive years and one pandemic later, housing insecurity or the lack of stable shelter, remains a significant issue for Milwaukee and other American cities. Eviction filings and orders have slowed because of eviction moratoriums and rental assistance programs created during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWhat happens when the moratoriums end? We don’t know yet. But we do know what happened in the years leading up to the pandemic. Research conducted by Marquette University Law School’s Lubar Center for Public Policy and Civic Education adds new insights into eviction in Milwaukee.\nAmong our findings:\nAs part of the Lubar Center’s Milwaukee Area Project, we collected and analyzed data from 2016 through 2020 but focused largely on the four years before the pandemic.\nThis analysis uses a unique, linked dataset of Milwaukee County court eviction and property records built and maintained by Branden DuPont at the Medical College of Wisconsin. We examined property data from the city assessor’s office and identified the owners of parcels or rental properties in the city. Because some landlords use multiple legal entities, we connected related ownership based on shared business addresses, corporate filings with the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions, company webpages and newspaper stories.\nWe looked at both eviction filings — the legal threat of eviction — and actual court-ordered evictions. For this story, we emphasize filings over orders because previous academic research shows many filings result in a tenant leaving a unit before a court date.\nWe do not attempt to account for informal evictions, which Desmond says are common. They might include paying a tenant to move out of a property, forced moves resulting from landlord foreclosures or building condemnations.\nHere’s what we learned:\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, formal evictions occurred at a stable pace across the city of Milwaukee. About 12,000 evictions were filed each year from 2016 through 2019. Over this period, the number of filings resulting in court-ordered evictions declined each year, from a high of approximately 5,700 in 2016 to a low of about 5,000 in 2019.\nThe pandemic greatly disrupted the eviction process. Total filings declined 35% in 2020 compared with 2019. Court-ordered evictions declined even more, 64%. From the beginning of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s limited eviction moratorium in September 2020 through mid-June 2021, filings declined by 48% compared with the average of previous years.\nIn the years immediately preceding the health crisis, eviction was extremely rare in some parts of the city, such as Bay View and the lower east side. Those neighborhoods are largely white and generally prosperous.\nFor example, from 2016 through 2019, there was an average of 102 eviction filings a year on the lower east side, which has the most rental units in the city. That would mean a yearly average of 14 eviction filings per 1,000 units, and just six court-ordered evictions per 1,000 units.\nMilwaukee’s Third Ward fared even better. In the same four-year period, the neighborhood known for high-end apartments and luxury condominiums had exactly four eviction filings and just one eviction order.\nIt was a far different story in other parts of the city. We found much higher rates of eviction filings in census tracts where the median rental household has an income less than $40,000, where more than 30% of that income is spent on rent, and where fewer than 25% of renters are white."

    "section": "The size of a landlord’s business matters",
    "text": "The size of a landlord’s business matters\nWhile eviction can be a complicated matter, at its core is a simple reality: Evictions are usually filed when a tenant doesn’t pay rent in a timely manner. But in poorer neighborhoods, eviction rates don’t neatly correspond with neighborhood measures of tenant poverty and housing cost burden.\nEviction filings were common in the northwest side’s Silver Spring neighborhood, which straddles its namesake thoroughfare between North 60th Street and West Fond Du Lac Avenue. The neighborhood saw an average of 204 eviction filings per 1,000 rental units, an eviction filing for roughly one out of five rental units each year. There was an average of 84 court-ordered evictions per 1,000 units. Among Milwaukee’s approximately 180 neighborhoods, Silver Spring ranks ninth in eviction filings.\nAt first glance, that was something of a surprise. Although Silver Spring has its struggles, it’s far from the poorest neighborhood in Milwaukee.\nSeventy-one neighborhoods have a higher percentage of tenants living in poverty. Forty-seven neighborhoods are home to a median renter with a lower household income, and the typical tenant in 60 neighborhoods has a higher housing cost burden. In other words, there are many neighborhoods where tenants tend to be poorer and rents more burdensome. But there aren’t many neighborhoods with more eviction filings.\nWhat made Silver Spring’s experience different is that a significant share of its properties was owned by a set of landlords with high eviction rates.\nFrom 2016 through 2019, the Berrada Group, Anchor Properties Group and George Sessler Group collectively owned about 15% of the neighborhood’s rental housing, while accounting for 40% of its eviction filings and 39% of its court-ordered evictions. Without the properties owned by these landlords, Silver Spring’s filing rate would fall by about 29%.\nBerrada’s rental business has been the subject of past Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporting. In a story a year ago, a representative of the company said eviction actions were “often required to get the attention of tenants who are behind in their lease payments. The eviction may be the only way to persuade a tenant to engage in discussions toward an acceptable payment plan.”\nIt’s important to note that the Berrada Group essentially halted evictions a short time later, before the CDC moratorium took effect in the late summer of 2020. We’ll discuss that more later.\nThis example illustrates an important finding in our research. When it comes to eviction, landlords vary in behavior, even when they own similar portfolios.\nWe used a statistical model to distinguish between different factors affecting eviction rates. Not surprisingly, we found that some demographic and property characteristics did predict higher eviction rates, but their influence paled in comparison to the effect of certain landlord traits, especially size.\nConsider a common housing situation in Milwaukee — a duplex owned by a smaller, Wisconsin-based landlord who owns 15 or fewer units. The house is the average age, size and value for rentals in Milwaukee, and the neighborhood’s tenants have average demographic characteristics. Our model predicted properties like this would have an eviction filing rate of 18 filings per 1,000 rental units each year.\nIf the landlord were based somewhere outside Wisconsin, we’d expect a filing rate of 29 per 1,000.\nBigger landlords file at much higher eviction rates. Large institutional investors with private equity backing have recently entered Milwaukee’s rental market. If one of these companies owned the duplex, our model predicted a filing rate of 131 per 1,000 units.\nIf the property were owned by a very large landlord (one who owns 100 or more units), the annual filing rate jumped to 159 per 1,000 rental units, an increase of 783% over the smaller, Wisconsin-based landlord.\nWe also looked at the behavior of neighborhood landlords, who we defined as individuals (not LLCs) who owned fewer than five properties, all within a half-mile of their own home. If one of these landlords owned the duplex, our model predicted a rate of just six filings per 1,000 rental units. That’s a two-thirds decline compared with the small owner who isn’t a neighborhood landlord.\nOther variables matter, too. If the small, Wisconsin landlord owned that duplex in a neighborhood where 80% of renters were Black, we’d expect a filing rate of 24 per 1,000. If just 20% of renters were Black, the predicted rate falls to 14. Likewise, if half of neighborhood tenants have a child, the model predicted a rate of 27 filings per 1,000, but only 12 if just 10% of renting households include a child.\nIn another illustration of systemic inequities, being poor, Black and living with kids makes a renter more susceptible to eviction. But our research is clear and consistent with other recent work from cities like Atlanta and Boston. The frequency of eviction filings depends more on the landlord than the tenant.\nIn fact, we found a relatively small number of property owners accounted for a disproportionate share of the filings from 2016 through 2019. For example, two landlords that combined own about 2.7% of the city’s rental housing stock were responsible for 17% of eviction filings and 15% of court-ordered evictions\nWe identified the Berrada property group from a list of several dozen LLCs listed at addresses connected to Youssef Berrada or Berrada Properties Management. Collectively, these companies were the city’s largest landlord, although they only owned about 2.3% of the city’s rental housing stock between 2016 and 2019. Still, Berrada accounted for 12% of all eviction filings and 10.5% of eviction orders.\nWe identified the Anchor Properties Group from a list of over a dozen LLCs connected to Anchor Properties’ address on Milwaukee’s northwest side. All the company names start with the letter “A,” including Anchor Properties LLC, Abuncha Properties LLC, Allsortsa Properties LLC, and Atunnu Properties LLC. The Anchor Properties Group filed the second most evictions during that same time. It owned 0.5% of the total housing stock but accounted for 5% of eviction filings and 4.5% of eviction orders.\nJust as a small number of owners filed an unusually high share of evictions, we found evictions to be highly concentrated in a small number of properties. Ten percent of rented parcels or properties are responsible for 75% of eviction filings. Just 8% of rented parcels account for 75% of eviction orders.\nMore than one in six evictions were filed in just 100 parcels, a statistic almost identical to Cleveland, Ohio, according to a study recently published by Desmond and Devin Q. Rutan.\nBecause evictions are so concentrated among specific properties and landlords, targeted interventions can have a big impact. After the initial eviction moratoriums expired in the summer of 2020, Berrada’s companies accounted for about a fifth of the city’s eviction filings in June and July — close to 500 in total. After negotiations with Legal Aid Milwaukee, the Berrada Group announced an eviction “hiatus.” The group filed fewer than 10 evictions during the CDC moratorium (through mid-June 2021). In contrast, the Anchor Properties Group filed around 390.\nNo one knows what will happen when the CDC moratorium expires on Aug. 1, but if the Berrada Group and its community partners continue to find alternatives to evictions it would significantly reduce housing insecurity in Milwaukee."

    "text": "‘Serial eviction filing’ isn’t just about eviction\nFinally, we also found evidence of a phenomenon that has been known as “serial eviction filing.” In simple terms, we found repeated eviction filings against the same name at the same address.\nAs a legal process, eviction is designed to let property owners reclaim their properties when a contract is broken.\nBut the practice of serial filing suggests entering eviction court may have other purposes. In a 2020 study, co-authors Desmond, Lillian Leung and Peter Hepburn described it this way:\n“Property owners may rely on the threat of eviction to collect rent and discipline tenants. This strategy may also allow property owners to profit from late payments. Tenants threatened with eviction not only must pay their rent in full; they are also charged late fines and legal fees, including costs associated with attorneys and court filings.”\nThat same study also notes that, counterintuitively, filing an eviction can also be a strategy for retaining tenants.\n“That incentive grows each time a property owner files for eviction as each filing generates a court record that can limit tenants’ future housing options,” the study’s authors note. “In screening prospective tenants, property owners tend to view recent eviction records as disqualifying …”\nWe looked at the year 2018 in Milwaukee for evidence of what we refer to as “serial eviction chains.” That means a series of evictions filed against the same person at the same property while that property was owned by the same landlord. Of the 12,000 evictions filed in the city of Milwaukee, 40% were part of a serial eviction chain.\nForty-nine percent of the chains ended in an eviction order, while 51% ended with an eviction filing that did not result in a court-ordered eviction.\nData analysis shows that serial eviction filings were used frequently by some landlords, including the city’s two leading eviction-filing private landlords, Berrada and Anchor Properties. Thirty-five percent of Berrada’s eviction filings were part of a chain of at least three filings. For Anchor, that number was even higher, 43%.\nOur research found one Berrada renter has received more serial eviction filings than anyone else in Milwaukee during that five-year period, a total of 18, the most recent of which was filed last summer during the pandemic."

    "text": "‘A grasp on stable shelter’\nIn the five years since Matthew Desmond visited Marquette University Law School, the city has seen several notable changes in its housing market, some of which we’ve written about in this newspaper.\nDowntown apartment construction is booming, but there’s also a new emphasis on affordable housing in the city. There continues to be an exodus of city employees to the suburbs now that the residency requirement has ended. Owner-occupancy of single-family homes in Milwaukee finally stabilized last year after a decade of decline. The number of rental properties owned by city residents has fallen, with more properties owned by landlords who live in the suburbs or out of state.\nHow the pandemic will affect any or all of these trends is unclear. But Desmond’s words from his 2016 visit to Milwaukee still ring true:\n“This country affords us freedoms, freedom to better ourselves, to better our kids, improve our communities. But those freedoms are massively compromised if we don’t have a grasp on stable shelter.”"

    "section": "",
    "text": "This article originally appeared in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\nIt was an indelible image from a metropolitan area long known for its racial divide. As the Milwaukee Bucks pursued an NBA championship last July, tens of thousands of cheering fans stood shoulder to shoulder in the Deer District outside Fiserv Forum to watch the games on massive TV screens. The size of the watch parties was impressive. But what made the nightly celebrations memorable was the remarkable diversity, a sharp contrast to so many social gatherings in Milwaukee. Young and united by their love of the Bucks, the colorful crowds gave us a glimpse of the future, of what metro Milwaukee could be.\nToday’s reality is less idyllic. Most people of color live in the city. Most suburbs are largely white. In fact, new analysis of the 2020 U.S. Census Bureau count by the Lubar Center for Public Policy and Civic Education at Marquette University Law School reveals that metro Milwaukee still leads the nation in Black-white residential segregation, just ahead of New York, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, St. Louis, and Buffalo.\nBut beyond that headline, a more nuanced story is playing out in metropolitan Milwaukee. We’re changing, becoming more diverse and less segregated, even as we experience stagnating growth.\nThese are some of the key findings from analysis conducted as part of the Lubar Center’s Milwaukee Area Project. The new census count shows a metro area stuck in a slow-growth mode. Population in the four counties — Milwaukee, Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington — stood at 1,574,731 in the new census count. That’s an increase of 18,823 people in the last decade. The 1.2% growth rate is the metro’s second lowest ever, surpassing only the 1970s, when the population actually declined.\nThe census data also reveals a marked change in how Americans identify themselves. The number of people identifying as two or more races grew by 127% nationwide and 115% in the Milwaukee metro. The share of Milwaukee area residents simply marking “Some Other Race” grew by 309%.\nTraditionally, researchers have focused on “race alone” statistics, because bi- and multi-racial individuals were a small group. Given the large increase in people choosing multiple races, considering both groups — race alone and race in combination — is necessary to get an accurate sense of the population.\nThe Census Bureau asks about Hispanic or Latino identity separately from race, so these numbers include respondents of any race. The numbers below for white, Black, Asian, and Native American people are for people who didn’t identify as Hispanic or Latino."

    "text": "Hispanic or Latino population growth was strong\nHowever measured, some things are very clear. Across the entire metro, the Hispanic or Latino population increased by 35,300, or 24%. Without strong Hispanic population growth, metro Milwaukee would have seen its population decline.\nThe Asian population grew as well. The population of those identifying as “Asian alone” increased by 20,200, or 44%, while “Asian in combination” grew by 5,100.\nThe white population in metro Milwaukee declined. The population of those identifying as “white alone” fell 63,400 or 6%. That was partially offset by a 28,300 increase in those identifying as “white in combination with something else,” but however you measure it, the white population in metro Milwaukee is smaller today than it was a decade ago.\nChanges to Black and Native American population totals were less clear. The “Black alone” population declined by 5,600, or 2%. But “Black in combination” increased by 7,800.\nThe number of people who identified as “American Indian and Alaska Native” declined by 1,500, or 22%. But the number choosing this in combination with another race —usually white — grew by 8,600.\nIn addition to the way people identified themselves, some of the most striking findings were the dramatic population changes within the city of Milwaukee. The Census Bureau said the city lost 17,609 residents in the last decade. Its population now stands at 577,222, a 3% decline in the last decade and the lowest population since 1930. Some city officials have suggested there was an undercount, a claim we’ll address later.\nAccording to the census data, all but four of the city’s 15 aldermanic districts lost population, with the steepest declines on the north and near south sides.\nOn the north side, the 15th district lost 4,800 residents. The adjacent 6th district lost 4,200. The population of the 7th district fell 3,300. The population loss also extended further northwest, to the 2nd aldermanic district, which saw a decline of 2,900 residents.\nOn the near south side, the 8th district lost 2,500 residents, the 12th 2,000.\nSome of that population loss was offset by growth in other parts of the city, including downtown, the Third Ward, the Lower East Side, and Walker’s Point neighborhoods.\nThe 3rd aldermanic district covering the east side grew by 2,400 people. The 4th district covering downtown and the near west side gained 1,700 residents.\nThere was also growth on the far south and southwest sides. The 13th Aldermanic district added 1,700 new residents. The 11th added 1,600.\nAt first glance, that may be surprising. After all, these far south and southwest neighborhoods have historically been popular with public employees, and the end of the residency requirement affected these areas the most.\nLooking at maps of population change by race suggests a possible explanation for the population increases. There has been a notable increase in the Hispanic population in the far south and southwest sides, plus an increase in the Black population in the Enderis Park area and far northwest side. The exit of public employees from these historically desirable neighborhoods may have created an opportunity for Black and Hispanic residents of the city’s more central neighborhoods to move outwards."

    "section": "Milwaukee becomes somewhat less segregated",
    "text": "Milwaukee becomes somewhat less segregated\nThe population shifts in the last decade have resulted in the city becoming less segregated. The Hispanic population declined on the near south side and increased in most other parts of the city. The Black population declined on the near north side but increased in historically white areas. The white population declined everywhere except along the lake and parts of the near west and near north sides. The Asian population increased everywhere, particularly on the far south side.\nOverall, the share of Milwaukee’s population identifying as Black alone fell by 15,100 in the last decade and stood at 38%. Another 2% identified as Black in combination with another race — usually white.\nWhite alone fell by 33,800 to 32%. Five percent more identified as white plus another race.\nHispanic or Latino increased by 13,300 to 20%.\nThose identifying as Asian alone increased by 9,400 to 5% of the city. Another 1% identified as Asian in combination with at least one other race.\nThe population identifying as Native American or Alaska Native fell by 1,000 to less than 1%, but the population choosing this identity in combination with something else grew by 800.\nLike the city, there is increasing diversity in Milwaukee’s suburbs. The total number of suburban residents identifying as white (either alone or in combination) declined by 8,300, or 1%, over the last decade — the first such decline in any census. The biggest decreases were in West Allis, which has 6,500 fewer white residents than a decade ago. Greenfield lost 2,600 white residents, the city of Waukesha, 1,900.\nThe white population grew the most in Oconomowoc and the city of Pewaukee, which added 2,100 and 2,000 respectively.\nThe Black suburban population grew roughly 50%, adding 14,100 new residents. The biggest increases were in West Allis, which added 2,000 Black residents. Brown Deer added 1,400 and Wauwatosa 1,200.\nThe Asian population in the suburbs also grew by 50%, adding 14,600 new residents. The biggest increase was in Brookfield, which added 2,500. Menomonee Falls had 1,300 new Asian residents. Oak Creek had 1,100.\nThe Hispanic population in the suburbs grew by 18,200, an increase of 38%. The Latino population grew by 3,800 in West Allis, by 1,800 in Greenfield, and by 1,000 in Waukesha.\nThe census data also shows that for the first time, two suburbs, West Milwaukee and Brown Deer, were majority minority. Only 46% of West Milwaukee residents were non-Hispanic white in 2020, down from 61% a decade ago. In the latest census, 48% of Brown Deer residents identified as white. Ten years ago, 62% were white.\nStill, the two suburbs remain outliers in metro Milwaukee. The third most diverse suburb was West Allis, where non-Hispanic white residents made up 73% of the population. Greenfield was 75% white, Cudahy 78%, Waukesha and Oak Creek, 79%. All other suburbs were at least 80% white.\nThe suburbs surrounding Milwaukee continue to fuel what population growth there is in the metro area. Brookfield added 3,500 new residents in the last decade, Menomonee Falls grew by 2,900. Oak Creek and Mequon both added more than 2,000 residents.\nThere was also growth in the far western suburbs. The city of Pewaukee added 2,700 residents, a 21% increase in population. Oconomowoc grew by 2,400, a 15% increase.\nYet there are signs that population growth is slowing outside the city. One suburb, South Milwaukee, lost nearly 400 people. Waukesha County added 17,100 people in the last decade, an increase of 4.4%. But that is the lowest growth rate for the county since the 1870s.\nWashington County grew by 4,900 new residents, an increase of 3.7%. That’s down from 12.3% in the 2000s, and 23.3% in the 1990s. This is the first decade since the 1930s in which Washington County didn’t experience double-digit growth.\nAs part of our analysis, we compared metro Milwaukee’s population growth in the last decade to that of other Midwestern cities. The only significant metro that grew more slowly was Cleveland’s, which had a population increase of 11,000, a 0.5% growth rate. Again, metro Milwaukee added approximately 18,800 people, for a growth rate of 1.2%\nDuring the same period, metropolitan Madison added 75,400 people and grew at a 12.4% rate. The Indianapolis metro area added 223,200 residents, an 11.8% increase. The population of the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro was up 356,600 over a decade ago, an increase of 10.7%. Kansas City’s metro area grew by 182,700, a 9.1% increase. Metropolitan Cincinnati’s population increased 119,200, or a rate of 5.6% growth.\nThe metropolitan Chicago area grew at a pace more like ours, 1.7%. St. Louis had the same growth rate as metro Milwaukee, 1.2%\nIf you compare only cities, and not metro areas, Milwaukee’s 3.0% decline was better than St. Louis, which lost 5.5% of its population, and Cleveland, which lost 6.1% of its residents.\nOn the other side of the ledger, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and Madison all grew by double digits.\nIn the new census count, the Milwaukee area ranked as the 41st largest metro in the country. It was 40th 10 years ago. The area ranked 285th out of 392 metro areas in the rate of population growth in the last decade.\nAll measures of Milwaukee’s population agree that there has been a decline since 2010. The size of that decline in the 2020 census came as a surprise because it was 12,600 people fewer than the most recent estimate from the Census Bureau’s Population Estimates Program (PEP), which is calculated using administrative data on births, deaths, and migration.\nSome observers have suggested the census undercounted Milwaukee, but another explanation is plausible. Compared with the 2020 census, PEP much more accurately estimated the county’s population as a whole but assigned too much of it to the city and too little to the suburbs. PEP used the 2010 average household size to divide the county’s population into municipalities. But in the latest census, Milwaukee City’s average household size declined, while the suburbs stayed about the same. Take a typical set of 20 homes in Milwaukee and about two fewer people live in them now, compared with 2010.\nAccording to the census, the number of children in Milwaukee declined by 16,900 —consistent with shrinking household sizes. Total housing units actually increased over this period, but typical new construction was designed for singles and couples instead of families with kids. Even as the number of kids plummeted, the census counted only 700 fewer adults in Milwaukee.\nOther data sources also show fewer children. For decades, the number of kids being born in Milwaukee has been smaller than the number of kids born 18 years previously. About 16,000 fewer babies were born during 2010-2019 than during 1992-2001—the cohort who became adults during the 2010s.\nPopulation growth is not necessarily the only or even best way to measure the health and vitality of a major metropolitan area. Bigger is not always better, if it means a diminished quality of life for its citizens.\nBut population growth does tell us something about whether a city or metro area is viewed as a desirable place to live, work, and raise a family. The images from the Deer District in July spoke volumes about the possibilities of Milwaukee, about the destination we could be in the future. The new census count suggests we’re not there yet."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This article originally appeared in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n“Are you better off than you were four years ago?”\nThat question, asked by Republican presidential candidate Ronald Reagan in 1980, was pivotal in the race for the White House.\nSo, in the spirit of this election year, let’s ask the question again, but with a twist.\nIs the metro Milwaukee area better off today than it was 40 years ago, in 1980, the year of Reagan’s famous words?\nThe economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak makes that a tricky question. Some people would argue that given the moment, the answer is “no.” But even before the pandemic hit, metro Milwaukee was faring worse than it did in 1980 in a key measurement of economic prosperity: median household income.\nIn real dollars, adjusted for inflation, households today in our metropolitan area earn less than they did 40 years ago.\nThe city of Milwaukee has seen the sharpest decline in income, followed by the Milwaukee County suburbs. But perhaps surprisingly, suburbs and communities in the WOW counties — Waukesha, Ozaukee, and Washington — have also struggled, especially in recent years.\nThe data used for this story was compiled and analyzed as part of the Milwaukee Area Project at Marquette University Law School’s Lubar Center for Public Policy Research and Civic Education.\nIt reinforces some of what we know about our metro area.\nThere is a large wealth gap between the city and the communities that surround it, as well as big differences in white and minority household income.\nBut the data also reveals a region — arguably the economic engine of the state — still struggling to find its footing after two recessions, one in the early 2000s and the Great Recession of 2008. Our household income growth lagged the nation even before we were hit by a third economic contraction brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic."

    "section": "Where the data came from",
    "text": "Where the data came from\nBefore we take a closer look at the data, let’s talk about where we got it. We calculated demographic and household income using individual Census interviews from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS USA at the University of Minnesota). The most recent data is from 2018.\nNational income data is from the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement.\nWage data is from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The most recent data is from 2019.\nWe focus in this story on median household income rather than per capita income. Median household income includes all income earned by those living in a household. That could mean families, unmarried couples, or singles. We think it’s the most accurate way to measure economic prosperity. Here’s why: Rapidly growing wages among the richest workers can raise per person averages even when people in the middle see no improvement. Also, many of the largest expenses are made at the household level, so two people earning $40,000 each are better off economically when they live together, even though their per capita income is unchanged.\nWhen we compare household income from one year to another, we adjust for inflation. We’re talking about “real dollars.”\nAnd we use the U.S. Census Bureau’s definition of the Milwaukee metro area — Milwaukee, Waukesha, Ozaukee, and Washington counties.\nTo understand what’s happened in metro Milwaukee since 1980, it’s helpful to note what has and hasn’t changed during the last four decades.\nHousehold size has remained remarkably consistent since 1980. Forty years ago, the average household in the city of Milwaukee had 2.5 members; now it is 2.4. The average suburban household had 2.8 members in 1980 and 2.3 now. This larger decline is mostly because there are fewer suburban families with kids at home. The share of households with one earner compared to two has changed very little in either the city or the suburbs since 1980.\nWhat has changed is the region’s geographic and economic balance of power during the last four decades.\nThe city’s share of the metro’s population shrank.\nMilwaukee County suburbs’ share remained about the same.\nPopulation in the WOW counties grew.\nIn 1980, 31% of the residents of metro Milwaukee lived outside Milwaukee County. Today, nearly 40% do. But the WOW counties’ evolution from commuter suburbs to full participant in the metro economy is the bigger story. In 1980, 15% of metro Milwaukee’s jobs were in the WOW counties. Today that number is 42%.\nBut what about the region’s relative prosperity?\nIn 1980, the nation’s median household income was $54,000. The city of Milwaukee closely mirrored that number, at $53,000. But by 2018 — the last year for which data was available — the nation’s median household income had grown to $64,000. The city’s household income had fallen to $44,000.\nThe city’s suburbs and surrounding areas remain relatively prosperous compared to the rest of the nation, and especially the city. But even their median household income today — $73,000 — is $5,000 less than it was in 1980.\nSome of the decline can be traced to events in the first decade of the 21st century. Times were tough for the average American household. The nation experienced two economic downturns, including the Great Recession of 2008.\nMetro Milwaukee is still trying to recover.\nMilwaukee has become a poorer city since the turn of the century. In real dollars, households in Milwaukee today earn $6,000 a year less than they did in 2000.\nResidents outside the city experienced the same downward trend. Median household income in the suburbs and outlying areas peaked at $86,000 in 2000. Since then, income has fallen $13,000 dollars per household. In Waukesha, the largest and wealthiest suburban county, incomes declined $8,000. Median incomes fell $14,000 in Ozaukee County and $13,000 in Washington County.\nWhile they both saw declines, the economic fortunes of the suburbs and the city they surround couldn’t be more different. The median household outside the city earns nearly $30,000 a year more than a household in the city.\nThe metro area’s racial disparity is glaring. Household income for Black and Latino residents today is less than what it was in 1980. Black residents today have a median household income of $30,000 in the city and $39,000 in the suburbs. Latino residents have a median household income of $45,000 in the city and $52,000 in the suburbs.\nWhat has happened to Black household income in Milwaukee is especially concerning. Since 1980, it has declined significantly across the board. The poorest households became poorer. Middle-class household income fell roughly 20%. That stands in stark contrast to the U.S. average for black households, which showed at least some household income growth across all income groups.\nIn 1980, a middle-class Black family in Milwaukee could expect to earn about $6,000 more than the national average for Black households. Now, a middle-income Black family in Milwaukee earns around $10,000 less.\nWhite residents of the metro area fare significantly better. Median household income today is $56,000 in the city and $77,000 in the suburbs. When adjusting for inflation, that’s roughly the same as it was in 1980.\nOne interesting finding in our analysis was this: Consistent with the “back-to-the-city” phenomenon, white city of Milwaukee residents were least-harmed by the Great Recession. Urban white households were the only group in our data to have almost completely recovered financially.\nMetro Milwaukee’s household income trends have moved in the opposite direction of national trends. We’re lagging the nation in growth. The question is why.\nAfter all, since 2000, most occupations saw their average annual wages rise. In addition, labor force participation rates remained remarkably consistent. There are somewhat fewer men now in the workforce, but that difference has been made up by women.\nA closer examination of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics reveals what’s happened."

    "title": "By one key measure, household income, metro Milwaukee is worse off than it was in 1980",
    "section": "The role of manufacturing",
    "text": "The role of manufacturing\nThe impact of the Great Recession saw metro Milwaukee shed 68,000 jobs from 2000 to 2010. But in the years that followed, the economy added back about 62,000 jobs, leaving us with about 6,000 fewer jobs than we had 19 years ago.\nAnd 4,400 of the jobs lost were in the public sector.\nPrior to the pandemic, the private sector had basically recovered all its job losses during the Great Recession. But dig a little deeper, and you see a significant change that explains the decline in the region’s household income: the disappearance of thousands of higher-earning jobs.\nManufacturing still accounts for 16% of private-sector jobs in metro Milwaukee. But today, there are 45,000 fewer manufacturing jobs than there were in 2000 — only 10 metros have lost more. Manufacturing jobs pay an average of $67,000 a year.\nThere are also 7,000 fewer jobs in the finance and insurance sector. Those jobs pay an average of $100,000 a year.\nMany other traditional middle-income jobs have also declined in number.\nIn contrast, the metro economy has added jobs in lower-paying sectors. For example, from 2000 to 2019, metro Milwaukee added 13,000 jobs in the accommodation and food service workers sector, which includes servers, cooks, and food preparation workers. The average wage is $18,000 a year.\nThe largest employer in the metro Milwaukee area today is the health care/social assistance sector. That includes registered nurses, nursing assistants, and personal care aides.\nThat sector accounts for nearly 19% of the region’s private-sector jobs. It’s also the fastest-growing sector. Since 2000, we’ve added 37,000 health care and social assistance jobs. They pay an average wage of $48,000, $19,000 less than the average manufacturing job.\nThe region is seeing exponential growth in one higher-paid sector of the economy: “management of companies and enterprises.” Think private equity and management firms.\nThose jobs, with an average wage of $115,000 a year, still amount to only 3.5% of metro Milwaukee’s private sector employment. But they have tripled in number in the last two decades, an additional 15,000 high-paying jobs for the area. Only five metros have added more jobs in this category. Collectively, these jobs bring home 7.4% of the Milwaukee metro’s wages, contributing to an increase in overall per capita earnings that doesn’t extend down the income ladder.\nThere are other contributing factors to metro Milwaukee’s decline in median household income. As we mentioned, the metro area shed 4,400 public sector jobs in the last decade. Those jobs typically pay middle-class wages.\nIn addition, the population in the WOW counties is aging. The number of suburban households not participating in the labor market has increased from 19% in 1980 to 27% in 2018.\nWe estimate a fifth of suburban households are entirely composed of retirees over the age of 60, compared to just 13% in the city. These suburban retiree households have a median income of $35,000, so their growing share of the population is one of the sources of the decline in household incomes.\nThe story of household income in metro Milwaukee bears some resemblance to other Midwestern cities, but not in a good way. In real dollars, Detroit and Cleveland have also seen their median household income decline since 1980, and by an even larger amount than Milwaukee.\nSome other Midwestern metros have fared better. Household income for metro Indianapolis is the same as it was in 1980. The Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis metro areas have seen a modest increase, while Madison and Minneapolis have seen significant gains.\nAs we reported in June of this year, metro Milwaukee’s population has been in a slow or no-growth mode since 2000. That is reflected in employment numbers. Despite two recessions in the 2000-2010 decade, the Minneapolis, Indianapolis, and Kansas City metro areas all added tens of thousands of employees to their economies from 2000 to 2019. The Minneapolis-St. Paul metro added 235,000. Indianapolis added 201,000. Both had such strong population and jobs growth that their metro areas physically expanded. Kansas City added 92,000 employees.\nIn contrast, metro Milwaukee lost more than 6,200 employees during that period. That performance ranked Milwaukee 309th out of 352 metro areas, but it was still better than Detroit, which lost 152,000 employees, and Cleveland, which lost 87,000.\nMetro Milwaukee fared slightly better in the category of average pay increase. Since 2000, average pay has climbed $3,500, but that increase still put us in the bottom third among metro areas.\nA lot has changed in metro Milwaukee since 1980 when Ronald Reagan famously asked voters if they were better off than they were four years ago. But at least one of those changes has not been for the better; the prosperity of its people today is not what it was it was four decades ago. And that was before COVID-19."

    "title": "Thousands of Milwaukee homes are no longer owned by city residents in a massive transfer of wealth since the Great Recession",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This article was originally published in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on January 30, 2020.\nThe Great Recession more than a decade ago hit Milwaukee hard. When the housing market collapsed, the city suffered through a tidal wave of foreclosures. Residential property values plummeted; they didn’t bottom out until 2016.\nSince then, housing values in most parts of the city have begun to rebound, although they generally remain well below their pre-recession peaks.\nBut Milwaukee’s housing market has changed in other fundamental ways:\nSimply put: Thousands of residential properties in Milwaukee are no longer owned by city residents. They’re owned, instead, by individuals and companies with mailing addresses in the suburbs, other parts of Wisconsin, or out-of-state altogether.\nThese trends raise questions about the long-term health of city neighborhoods, particularly those that are home predominantly to people of color.\nThis latest reporting is a follow-up to a story in November that looked at the impact of the end of Milwaukee’s residency requirement. Data compiled and analyzed by Marquette Law School’s Milwaukee Area Project found thousands of middle-class residents — city and Milwaukee Public Schools employees — were no longer living in Milwaukee.\nBut these other housing changes — the decline in owner-occupancy coupled with a sharp increase in properties owned by non-city residents — caught our attention.\nHere’s how we analyzed the publicly available data:\nWe began by looking at owner-occupancy rates for residential properties in the city. Owner-occupancy was determined by comparing the address of the property with the owner’s address.\nWe defined residential properties as single-family homes, duplexes, triplexes, four-unit dwellings, and condominiums. That constituted 70% of all housing units in Milwaukee in 2019. We excluded larger commercial apartment buildings from the analysis. We consider houses to be “rentals” when they aren’t owner-occupied.\nUsing this definition, we determined that in 2019, Milwaukee had about 87,700 single-family homes, 33,400 duplexes, 11,200 condos, and 2,600 triplexes or four-unit dwellings. We examined data from 1990 to 2019.\nHere’s what we learned.\nThe share of owner-occupied residential properties in Milwaukee remained steady during the 1990s and early 2000s. But the Great Recession proved to be a great disrupter.\nIn 2005, at the market’s peak and just before the recession, the city recorded 107,000 owner-occupied properties. By 2019, that number had fallen to 93,000. In 2005, 80% of the residences were owner-occupied. By 2019, that number had fallen to 69%.\nOwner-occupancy rates have declined for every housing type. They were down 12% each for single-family homes and duplexes. Triplexes and four-unit dwellings were down 10%. Condos fell by 9%.\nThe trend is evident citywide but is much more pronounced on the north and west sides of Milwaukee, in the 1st, 2nd, and 7th aldermanic districts.\n• In the 1st district, owner-occupancy fell from 78% in 2005 to 56% in 2019.\n• In the 2nd district, it fell from 87% to 65% during the same period.\n• In the 7th district, it dropped from 74% to 54%.\nMeanwhile, owner-occupancy in the 3rd district (east side), 4th district (downtown), 11th district (southwest), and 13th district (far south) all declined by just 5%.\nAs that pattern suggests, minority communities were hurt the most by the housing crisis and the Great Recession. Homeownership fell by an average of 5.5% in mostly white census tracts but declined by 10.3% in mostly Latino census tracts, and 16.6% in majority-black census tracts.\nSo, we know more city residents are renting. But who owns the properties they’re living in?\nA review of the data provides two answers."

    "section": "Number of non-resident landlords grows in Milwaukee",
    "text": "Number of non-resident landlords grows in Milwaukee\nFirst, the number of landlords owning multiple properties in Milwaukee has dramatically increased. The popularity of limited liability companies (LLC’s) has skyrocketed from a negligible number of properties owned in the early 1990s to more than 13,000 in 2019. LLC ownership is concentrated in single-family homes and duplexes. It quadrupled from 2005 to 2019.\nSecond, the number of landlords residing outside the city has exploded. Half of all rented properties are now owned by someone outside Milwaukee. From 2005 to 2019, the holdings of suburban landlords grew 70%, from nearly 7,700 properties to more than 13,000.\nDuring that same period, residential properties owned by someone who lives in Wisconsin but not in the suburbs grew from just under 1,000 to nearly 2,300.\nBut perhaps the most significant development in the city’s housing market in the last 15 years is this:\nLandlords with addresses outside Wisconsin quadrupled their holdings over that time, from 1,300 properties to more than 5,800.\nIn the 2nd district on the city’s northwest side, more than a third of all residential properties — 35% — are owned by a landlord. Fewer than half of these rented properties are owned by someone who lives in Milwaukee. Thirty-six percent are owned by a landlord with a suburban address and 17% by someone with an out-of-state address.\nThe number of properties owned by someone outside Wisconsin grew from 77 in 2005 to 573 in 2019."

    "section": "Housing wealth in Milwaukee is being transferred to out-of-state investors",
    "text": "Housing wealth in Milwaukee is being transferred to out-of-state investors\nThe change in ownership of residential properties in Milwaukee has resulted in an enormous transfer of family housing wealth to out-of-state individuals and businesses. Landlords with Illinois addresses now own more than 1,600 residential units in Milwaukee. Landlords in California own 1,400 units. Texas landlords own nearly 700. Keep in mind that none of these figures includes large apartment buildings.\nIn all, out-of-state landlords now own more than $580 million in residential properties in the city of Milwaukee. That number grew by $396 million in just the last 15 years.\nWhile it’s not a prediction of the future, it’s worth noting that median property values in aldermanic districts where owner-occupancy rates have declined the most have been among the slowest to recover from the Great Recession. And even when property values have recovered, Milwaukee residents have received a dwindling share of the returns."

    "section": "Some of the questions Milwaukee faces",
    "text": "Some of the questions Milwaukee faces\nA recent story in the publication, CityLab, noted that more than 12 million single-family homes are currently being rented in the United States. Following the housing collapse, attitudes toward homeownership changed. Some individuals couldn’t afford to buy a home; others no longer saw owning a home as part of a strategy to create personal wealth.\nSo the trend away from owner-occupancy is not simply a Milwaukee phenomenon. But what’s happening in Milwaukee does raise interesting questions:\nIs the decline in owner-occupancy a long-term trend?\nWill the number of residential properties owned by people who don’t live in the city — or state — continue to grow?\nWhat does the decline mean for individuals and their ability to create and build wealth — particularly for people of color whose neighborhoods have been affected the most by this trend?\nThe answers to those questions will be important. For decades, Milwaukee was a city of strong, cohesive neighborhoods, its residents bound in part by something they had in common: the investment in their home.\nFor some parts of the city, that is no longer the case."
