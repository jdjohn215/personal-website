The largest tree of its species is called a “Champion Tree.” The nonprofit American Forests has run a competition to identify national champion trees in the United States for the past 80 years. This map shows the locations of each tree in 2019.

Just four states–North Dakota, South Dakota, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin–have no champion trees. Florida has the most (106), followed by Virginia (90), Texas (77) and Arizona and California (both 58).
