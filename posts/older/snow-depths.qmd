This gif shows snow depths at every U.S. weather station on each day from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018. Blue dots indicate snow on the ground; the size of the dot represents the depth of the snow. The faint, small tan dots represent weather stations.

All data is from NOAA. Strange outliers may be data entry errors.
